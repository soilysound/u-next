The bodies of the pair were then taken outside to the Reich Chancellery garden, doused in petrol and burnt.</p><p>The story was quickly reported around the world, Hitler was dead and Germany was on the brink. Barely a week later, the war in Europe was over.</p><p>This official account of how Hitler died — promoted by the Americans, Russians, and British, became the truth of the matter for public consumption.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-death-newspaper-report.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Hitler’s death is reported in newspapers around the world.</div></figcaption></figure><p>However, privately the Allies doubted the story.

Eisenhower told reporters that there was “reason to believe he[Hitler] was still alive.”</p><p>The Russian account of what happened after they had seized Hitler’s bunker was confused and contradictory. And most tellingly, there was no body. Could Hitler have escaped?</p><p>Rumours began to circulate that Hitler and Braun had been smuggled out of Germany at the last minute and sightings of them came in from all over the world. The FBI and OSS, the forerunner to the CIA, investigated many of these rumours.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-and-eva-braun.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Hitler and his future wife Eva Braun</div></figcaption></figure><p>Some authors have suggested Hitler was flown out of Germany just days before the end of the war, under the code name ‘Grey Wolf’, and then smuggled out of Europe in a German U-boat to Nazi sympathising Argentina.</p><p>There, the theory goes, he lived out his life under an assumed name with his wife Eva Braun and their children until his death in the early 60s.</p><p>Did Hitler really escape to Argentina after WW2?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>The Body</h3><p>Nobody at the Führerbunker saw Hitler shoot himself, and there are no authentic photographs of his corpse.</p><p>When advancing Russian troops seized the Reich Chancellory they found several bodies but, after initially mistaking a decoy named Gustav Weler for the Fuhrer, were unable to positively identify any of them as Hitler.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-chancellory-garden.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Russians later claimed to have found Hitler’s charred body in this garden.</div></figcaption></figure><p>Marshal Zhukov, the head of the Russian army told a press conference — “We did not identify the body of Hitler, I can say nothing definite about his fate. He could have flown away from Germany at the last moment.”</p><p>In 1968, the Russians changed their story. They had in fact recovered Hitler's charred remains and reburied them on several occasions. They had a skull, some teeth, and a jawbone fragment to prove it.</p><blockquote><span>\"We did not identify the body of Hitler, I can say nothing definite about his fate.

They were the only hard, physical evidence in existence for Hitler’s death but without access, they could not be subject to forensic testing.</p><p>It wasn’t until 2009 that experts were finally allowed to examine the bone fragments. A team of American investigators, led by archaeologist Nick Bellantoni, took samples from the skull and jawbone for DNA testing. The results were shocking.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-bone-fragments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The bone fragments held by the Russians were not from Hitler</div></figcaption></figure><p>None of the samples belonged to Hitler.

Whatever the answers, the DNA results seriously undermined the official story.</p><h3>Allied Intelligence</h3><p>The Allied forces secretly doubted Hitler had committed suicide. Even before the war ended American intelligence were preparing for the possibility of Hitler’s escape.</p><p>The OSS, then America’s foreign intelligence agency, prepared a series of mocked-up images of Hitler in various disguises, anticipating how he may try to escape at the end of the war.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/oss-mockups-hitler-disguise.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The OSS anticipated Hitler's escape</div></figcaption></figure><p>Army intelligence interrogating a young SS officer at Nuremberg discovered he had actually observed Hitler’s flight from Germany just before the end of the war.</p><p>This appeared to confirm newspaper reports at the time that SS pilot Peter Baumgart had flown Hitler out of Germany to Denmark in a Junker 52 transport aircraft on April 28th.</p><p>Beginning shortly after the war, the FBI conducted a decade-long investigation into the alleged escape of Hitler. Compiling a 700-page dossier, the FBI gathered reports of his survival from around the world.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-escape-plane.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Claims emerged that Hitler was flown out of Germany to Denmark</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the reports were hoaxes and nonsense, including sightings of Hitler disguised as a croupier at a casino and walking around in New York City. But there were also a cluster of more credible reports that centered on Argentina.</p><p>Accounts of Hitler’s arrival by submarine and his life in the country were numerous. One informant gave the FBI detailed descriptions of Hitler and his precise whereabouts in Argentina, but these were never followed up.</p><p>Argentina, under the fascist rule of Juan Peron, had a large German community and one of the biggest Nazi parties in the world outside of Germany. Like many other South American countries, it was sympathetic to the crumbling Nazi regime and prepared to hide fleeing Nazi war criminals.</p><p>Recently, Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams in their book Grey Wolf followed up some of the Argentina rumours. The developed evidence that Hitler hid out at a remote pro-Nazi enclave near Nahuel Huapi Lake in Patagonia.</p><p>The authors found several eyewitnesses who remember Hitler’s presence there and interviewed one now elderly man who claims to have served Hitler on two occasions in 1953 and 1956 in a private hotel suite.</p><h3>Nazi ratlines</h3><p>Some evidence from other fugitive Nazis supports the idea that Hitler may have escaped to Argentina.</p><p>Lots of other high-ranking Nazis escaped after WW2 with the help of ratlines set up by secret SS groups like Odessa, the Catholic Church and even American intelligence.</p><p>Both Josef Mengele and Adolf Eichman, two of the most notorious Nazi war criminals, escaped to South America after the war, where they were protected by pro-Nazi fascist dictatorships in countries like Chile and Argentina.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/adolf-eichman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Adolf Eichmann escaped to Argentina</div></figcaption></figure><p>Argentina especially was a hotspot for escaping Nazis. Millions of dollars of Reich assets were smuggled out of Germany at the end of the war and funneled through the Peron regime into Argentina to help set up an underground regime to protect ex-Nazis.</p><p>If Hitler had escaped Germany, the odds are he would have ended up in Argentina where he could have been sure of a safe haven from the international authorities.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Eyewitnesses in the Bunker</h3><p>There are several direct eyewitness accounts from inside Hitler’s bunker that attest to his suicide there.</p><p>SS Officer Rochus Misch, a Hitler aide, claims the Fuhrer had already made it clear he would end his life, apparently terrified that his body may be paraded by the approaching Russian army.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/adolf-hitler-profile.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Eyewitnesses in the bunker say Hitler was determined not to be taken alive</div></figcaption></figure><p>According to Misch, Hitler ordered them to destroy his body after his suicide. On April the 30th, the deed was done. Misch and other staff in the Führerbunker entered Hitler’s private room and discovered his and Braun’s bodies.</p><p>Misch recounts how they took the bodies of the pair up to the Chancellery garden to burn them. Hitler’s valet Otto Gunsche was in charge of the cremation but had struggled to round up enough petrol.</p><p>Finally, Gunsche and the other remaining Nazis set fire to the bodies and, before giving one last salute, retreated back into the bunker.</p><p>Whilst there are several such accounts amongst the witnesses to Hitler’s death, some historians have questioned their reliability due to the many inconstancies between them.</p><p>Several of the witnesses changed their stories over the years or made questionable claims that tend to undermine their veracity. Some witnesses said they heard the gunshot that killed Hitler, but Gunsche heard no shot despite been stood at the door to Hitler’s room.</p><h3>Hitler’s teeth</h3><p>Although not reported for many years, the Russians now confirm they performed an autopsy on Hitler’s remains in 1945 and confirmed them to be Hitler.</p><p>Partial remains of some of Hitler’s teeth were positively identified by his dentist as matching distinctive dental work he had performed on the Fuhrer the year before.</p><p>This identification appeared to be confirmed in 1999 when forensic dentist Prof Michel Perrier used newsreel footage, photographs, and X-rays to match the teeth to Hitler.</p><p>However, some critics have questioned the identification. Hugo Blaschke, the dentist who made the original match in 1945, did so entirely based on memory.</p><p>Hitler’s dental records were lost and instead Blaschke had to draw a picture of Hitler’s teeth as he remembered them.</p><h3>Cold war paranoia</h3><p>Many historians account for the inconsistencies in the stories of Hitler’s death and the recovery of his body to cold war secrecy and paranoia.</p><p>Almost as soon as WW2 ended, the cold war between Russia and the West began and a lot of lies and propaganda can be attributed to this period.</p><p>Most of the early evidence we have about Hitler’s demise comes from Russian counter-intelligence sources, working on Stalin’s orders.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-russian-propaganda.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Russian propaganda about Hitler’s demise</div></figcaption></figure><p>Stalin, historians say, was not only paranoid that news about Hitler’s death could be used against him, but decided to deliberately obscure the prosaic reality of his suicide to try and suggest the Western powers were hiding him.</p><p>Obsessive secrecy, disinformation, and propaganda became the norm, and it wasn’t until many years after Stalin died that the Russians finally began to open up their archives and reveal the truth about what happened in 1945.</p><h3>Hitler’s health</h3><p>Those who saw Hitler in the months up until his alleged death were shocked at his physical and mental deterioration.</p><p>SS Physician Ernst-Günther Schenck tended to Hitler in the final few days. According to Schenck, the 56-year-old Fuhrer was - \"a living corpse, a dead soul.\"</p><p>\"His spine was hunched, his shoulder blades protruded from his bent back, and he collapsed his shoulders like a turtle…I was looking into the eyes of death\", Schenck recounted in a 1985 interview.</p><p>Schenck, like other observers, noted how Hitler looked twenty years older that his true age — a physical and mental wreck whose left arm shook so uncontrollably he could hardly shave or feed himself.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/adolf-hitler-flight-of-grey-wolf/hitler-bunker.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The trashed bunker where Hitler spent his grim final days</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hitler, it seems, was suffering the mental and physical effects of degenerative disease Parkinsons.

Many now believe the fictional events portrayed in the show subversively reflect reality.</p><p>It has inspired hundreds of conspiracy theories about secret space missions, bases on the Moon and Mars and even off-world fleets of advanced spacecraft.</p><p>The fictional Alternative 3 culminates with the reporter decoding a video tape which reveals footage of a joint US/USSR mission to Mars in 1962. Could there be any truth in such an amazing notion? Are the space programs of the global superpowers really far more advanced than is admitted to the public?</p><p>In 2001, British hacker Gary McKinnon claimed to have found astonishing evidence that such an out of this world program really does exist. Hacking into top secret Pentagon military computers, McKinnon says he found a crew manifest file detailing ‘non-terrestrial’ officers.</p><p>Perhaps this was, at last, the smoking gun that proved Alternative 3 wasn’t entirely fictional.

And was their technology and progress far more advanced than NASA’s public space missions?</p><p>The USAF has long since run black projects that were so secret the public, and sometimes even congress, were completely unaware of their existence.</p><p>Various aircraft, such as the F-117A Nighthawk, were financed, developed, built and operated under total secrecy. The Nighthawk’s existence wasn’t revealed publicly until 1988, some 11 years after its first flight.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/lockheed-f-117-nighthawk.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The F-117 was a total secret for over a decade</div></figcaption></figure><p>Could they have similar top secret space projects that remain entirely unknown to the public? A look at those plans that were acknowledged reveals a curious pattern.</p><p>In the late 1950s, the USAF spent billions of dollars on Dyna-Soar, an advanced, reusable space plane. They then quietly announced its cancellation in 1963.</p><p>In the mid-60s, they canceled plans for a space station called the MOL — manned orbital laboratory.</p><p>Project Horizon was an ambitious plan for a manned moon base that predates NASA’s first moon landing in 1969. It too was discretely canceled before it could come to fruition.</p><p>In 1989, the New York Times reported that the Air Force had shut down yet another planned manned space program, with a staff of 32 astronauts and a space shuttle launching facility in Colorado.</p><p>Until the announcement, which appeared in just one newspaper, the existence of this massive, non-NASA space project was completely unknown.</p><p>It doesn’t seem credible that the USAF would spend so many hundreds of billions of dollars on multiple manned space programs and then quietly mothball them all with no results.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/manned-orbiting-laboratory-space-station.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">MOL was the USAF's ambitious plan for a space station</div></figcaption></figure><p>Could it be they were never canceled at all but continued in secret? And were there other, even more secret black projects we still know nothing about?</p><p>If so, these programs would have been far more advanced than anything NASA publicly achieved and move the prospect of the kind of secret space program envisaged in Alternative 3 closer to fact than fiction.</p><p>A curious diary entry by president Ronald Reagan in 1985 suggests such a possibility may not be so far-fetched.</p><p>In the diaries, published long after his presidency, Reagan recounts a meeting at the White House with several top space scientists.</p><p>On page 334 he states — \"It was fascinating. Space truly is the last frontier and some of the developments there in astronomy etc. are like science fiction, except they are real. I learned that our shuttle capacity is such that we could orbit 300 people\".</p><p>Presuming Reagan wasn’t simply confused or mistaken, this claim is impossible without the prospect of a secret space program.</p><p>America's space shuttle has a capacity of 8 people, and only 5 were ever built. The US does not, and never has had, at least officially, the technology to put 300 people into space.</p><p>The science fiction reference seemed apt. However, in 2001, a computer hacker from the UK found evidence that cast this obscure entry in Reagan’s diary in a sensational new light.</p><h3>The Hacker</h3><p>In 2002, Scottish computer enthusiast Gary McKinnon was accused by the US government of the “the biggest military computer hack of all time\".</p><p>Under the guise of ‘Solo’, McKinnon hacked into dozens of Pentagon, USAF, and NASA computers between 2001 and 2002.</p><p>US prosecutors sought his extradition and charged him with 7 counts of computer-related crime which could have seen McKinnon receive a 70-year prison sentence.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/gary-mckinnon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Gary McKinnon claimed to have found evidence for a secret space program</div></figcaption></figure><p>His roll call of alleged crimes was impressive: disabling critical systems at a navy airbase not long after 9/11, bringing down an entire network of 2000 US Army computers and copying, changing and deleting classified data.</p><p>McKinnon himself maintains his actions were not malicious and he was merely searching for evidence of UFOs and suppressed free energy technology. If he can be believed, what he found was incredible.</p><p>The first find was spreadsheet detailing a list of USAF officers, with their names and ranks. What was interesting about this was the file was titled ‘non-terrestrial officers’.</p><p>Based on what else he found, McKinnon does not think this is a reference to aliens, but human officers serving in space.</p><p>Also in the file was information about ship-to-ship transfers. What made this file doubly strange was none of the ship names, or indeed officers, seemed to exist.</p><p>McKinnon was aware of the case of Donna Hare, an ex-NASA employee who said the agency had a department in building 8 at the Johnson Space Centre whose job was to airbrush UFOs out of space images.</p><p>McKinnon found an unguarded computer at building 8 and looked for evidence to corroborate Hare’s story. Incredibly, he says he found it.</p><p>There were a series of folders on the computer labeled ‘raw’ and ‘processed’. Inside the raw folder, he found an image of large, silvery, cigar-shaped craft pictured in orbit over the northern hemisphere.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/johnson-space-center.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">McKinnon hacked into NASA computers at the Johnson Space Center</div></figcaption></figure><p>Could this be a spacecraft developed by a secret space program of the kind proposed in Alternative 3?</p><p>Critics of Gary McKinnon’s case question why he didn’t download or screen capture any of these images. The hacker himself also admits he was often high on marijuana and drunk when he hacked the computers.</p><p>Caveats aside, McKinnnon had provided some tantalising evidence in support for a secret space program. But it was still weak.</p><p>Was there anyone else to corroborate his claims?</p><h3>Disclosure</h3><p>Some ex-employees of NASA, the military, and its defense contractors have come forward in recent years with evidence that supports the secret space program theory.</p><p>Whilst some of these whistleblowers tell stories so bizarre and incredible they have to be discounted, others are more credible.</p><p>In 1965, Sgt Karl Wolfe was a young electronics expert at USAF tactical air command at Langley in Virginia.</p><p>One day he was called over to an NSA facility to examine a fault in some photographic equipment. The lab was processing images of the moon’s surface taken by the lunar orbiter.</p><p>One thing immediately struck Wolfe. There were hundreds of scientists from all over the world at the facility, speaking dozens of different languages. Wolfe felt this peculiar, especially at the height of the cold war.</p><p>He got talking with a photographic technician processing the lunar orbiter images. The man appeared disturbed. “We’ve found a base on the backside of the moon\", he said.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/artificial-moon-structures.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Some witnesses recall seeing artificial structures on the Moon</div></figcaption></figure><p>Wolfe was stunned. The technician then showed him contact prints that showed the base. Wolfe observed large domes, towers and what looked like radar dishes.</p><p>The fictional Alternative 3 suggested the secret space program had built a moon base as a staging point for a mission to Mars. Was this it?</p><p>Donna Hare tells a similar story. As a NASA contractor in the 1970s, she encountered an employee whose job it was to airbrush UFOs out of NASA photos.</p><p>Intrigued, Hare sniffed around for more information. She heard chatter that the Apollo astronauts had observed artificial structures and even spacecraft on the moon.</p><p>John Schuessler spent 36 years as an aerospace engineer at Boeing and worked on numerous NASA projects. He too recalled seeing Apollo images containing UFOs.</p><p>However, when accessing NASA’s official photo archive of the mission, he was unable to find the photos. The numerically indexed images had been removed from the collection.</p><p>Perhaps the most unlikely whistleblower for a secret space program is the military of France. In 2007, Col. Yves Blin of the French Department of Defence announced some very intriguing data gathered by their Graves space radar system.</p><p>Some 20–30 satellites were detected that appeared not to exist. The US Defense Department maintains a list of all satellites in orbit, including the classified military satellites of other countries, and none of these were listed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/alternative-3-secret-space-program/american-secret-satellites.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The US has secretly launched dozens of satellites</div></figcaption></figure><p>These mysterious satellites were, then, almost certainly launched by the US themselves. Whilst not evidence for Alternative 3, it did prove the existence of a clandestine space program of a kind.</p><p>Whatever the purpose of these satellites, they would require a large infrastructure back on earth — facilities, funding, technology, staff, rockets and launch pads, all operating in secret.</p><p>Is it too much of a stretch to suppose this infrastructure had achieved far more than just launching satellites?

Bill Sweetman, editor of Defense Technology International, estimated the US military black budget to be $50 billion in 2010.</p><p>To put that into context, NASA’s budget in the same year was just $17 billion. So huge amounts of money are available, but much of that is already spent on conventional black military projects — planes, missiles, bombs and so forth.</p><p>Other sources of revenue would still be needed beyond the traditional black budget dollars. And even if such funding could be secured, could it really be spent without anyone noticing?</p><p>A project on the scale of Alternative 3 would generate millions of financial transactions, employ 10s or 100,000s of people and involve hundreds of technology and engineering companies.</p><p>Could this really be done under absolute secrecy, without more people coming forward and admitting involvement?

Perhaps we would have habitable colonies on the Moon today, or staging posts for trips to Mars. And maybe we would have explored the dark side of the Moon, long rumoured to contain remnants of an ancient alien civilization.</p><p>In 2007, a mysterious figure took to video sharing website Youtube with evidence that this incredible scenario was not speculative fiction, but a clandestine fact, one hidden from the world to protect the truth about what they had found on Earth’s closest neighbour.</p><p>A user calling himself retiredafb posted a number of videos purporting to be footage of a secret Apollo 20 mission, jointly manned by US and Soviet astronauts, that took place in August 1976.</p><p>Retiredafb identified himself as William Rutledge, a now elderly and retired Nasa astronaut, in exile in Rwanda, who took part in the secret Apollo 20 mission alongside fellow astronauts Leona Marietta Snyder and Alexei Leonov.</p><p>According to Rutledge, Apollo 20's mission was to explore the polar region of the Moon, on its dark side, to investigate images supposedly taken by Apollo 15 of the area which showed what appeared to be a vast ancient city and a huge, miles-long crashed spacecraft.</p><p>Rutledge’s footage would be astonishing if true, as it shows both the alien city and a flyover of the cigar-shaped spaceship. The videos then cut to the Apollo 20 crew actually exploring the interior of the crashed ship, and perhaps most amazingly of all discovering the body of a human-like alien.</p><p>Dubbed ‘Mona Lisa’ by the astronauts, the body appeared to have been that of a young woman, partially mummified with a thin layer of a waxy substance covering its skin. She appeared to be locked into the controls of the spacecraft by a device connected to her eyes and nose.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/alien-body-apollo-20.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The alien body supposedly found by the Apollo 20 crew</div></figcaption></figure><p>In an interview with Italian journalist Luca Scantamburlo, Rutledge went into more details about their discovery of Mona Lisa, explaining that the EBE — Extraterrestrial Biological Entity, appeared to be neither alive or dead, but in some kind of state of suspended animation.</p><p>According to Rutledge, the alien was disconnected from the navigational device and returned back to Earth aboard the lunar module, where the body still resides today.</p><p>Rutledge also described the ship — “We went inside the big spaceship, also into a triangular one. The major conclusions of the exploration were: it was a mothership, very old, that crossed the universe at least a billion years ago”.</p><p>Understandably, due to the sensational nature of the videos, Rutledge’s posts to Youtube gathered millions of hits. But soon after he claims his account was hacked and the videos deleted. Was NASA trying to destroy the evidence of this most secret of missions?</p><p>If so, it did not work. Quickly Rutledge and others would set up multiple mirrored versions of the videos on several different video sharing websites, and they remain widely available.</p><p>But did NASA, or anyone, really need to worry? For many the story was simply too incredible to be believable. Indeed, more than one commentator noted how similar Rutledge’s claims were to a variety of science fiction films.</p><p>Could there be any truth in the Apollo 20 story?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>Hidden in plain sight</h3><p>Photographs of the lunar surface taken by Apollo 15 in 1971 do appear to show some strange anomalies in the Delporte-Izsak region in the southern region of the Moon’s dark side.</p><p>An unusual cigar-shaped object situated on the edge of a crater can clearly be seen in several of the NASA photographs circulating on the internet, including those on NASA’s own website. The feature looks to have mass and form and seems to sit on top of the Moon’s surface rather than be a part of it.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/apollo-20-craft.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The craft shown in Rutledge’s videos match the anomaly captured by Apollo 15</div></figcaption></figure><p>The spacecraft shown in Rutledge’s footage is a very close match for this object in both size and shape, but with far more surface detail evident.

But If they are a hoax he has managed to insert some authentic details into his story that at give it some hint of verisimilitude.</p><p>Whilst Rutledge and Leona Marietta Snyder appear in no official lists of NASA or Soviet astronauts, Alexei Leonov was an internationally respected Soviet cosmonaut best known for becoming the first man to walk in space in 1965.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/cosmonaut-alexei-leonov.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was supposed to be one of Apollo 20's secret crew.</div></figcaption></figure><p>For hoaxers to include such a high profile figure as Leonov was risky, as he could simply have come out with unassailable proof that he was elsewhere at the time of the mission and the whole deception would instantly fall apart.</p><p>Was this bold choice of using a real cosmonaut actually evidence for Apollo 20's authenticity? One figure shown briefly in the videos even looks like Leonov, which at least attests to an attention to detail.</p><p>Other aspects of the footage show that, if a hoax, the creators had access to either real Apollo mission hardware or a very good replica of it. Several shots in the videos showing the interior of the lunar module are exact and impressive replica of the real thing.</p><p>An Apollo 20 badge, complete with the names of the three astronauts, is also visible in some frames as further proof this is not simply recycled footage from one of the earlier official Apollo mission.</p><p>If Rutledge was really an imposter, then this part of the video was well produced. He must have had a decent sized budget to replicates a whole Apollo module interior inside a studio, indicating this was a professional operation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/interior-of-lunar-module.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The interior of the lunar module is convincingly reproduced in the videos</div></figcaption></figure><p>Alternatively, he may have somehow secured access to a real Apollo lunar module housed in a museum, although it seems unlikely any museum would ever consent to the filming of a hoax video in such a location.</p><p>Was the real reason Rutledge’s depiction of the modules interior was so accurate because it was genuinely filmed aboard a secret Apollo 20 mission to the Moon?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>A face in the darkness</h3><p>The are numerous examples of researchers and investigators discovering anomalous artifacts and structures in NASA photographs, both of the Moon and other planets in the solar system.</p><p>Author and lecturer Richard C Hoagland is a proponent of many such claims, most famously that of the ‘Face on Mars’ a striking formation in the Cydonia region of the planet’s surface that Hoagland insists is a giant alien statue of a human-like face.</p><p>Like many such observations, Hoagland’s work is based on poor quality, blurry photos, often nth-generation copies found on the internet. Invariably, when higher quality source images are found, many of these seemingly artificial structures prove to be optical illusions.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/face-on-mars.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The ‘Face on Mars’ is simply an optical illusion</div></figcaption></figure><p>That proved to be the case when newer, far higher resolution images gathered by probes such as NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor in 2003 showed the Cydonia face was merely a Martian hill, an entirely natural structure that only vaguely resembled a face when illuminated at the right angle.</p><p>Hoagland’s work is an example of a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia, the tendency of the human mind to perceive significant patterns where there are none. Often this takes the form of seeing human faces or animals in abstract or formless images.</p><p>William Rutledge’s story of Apollo 20 begins with the premise that Apollo 15 captured images of a giant cigar-shaped mothership on the dark side of the Moon. Many of the images circling on the internet today do show what appears to be an artificial object, but they are low resolution and lack detail.</p><p>Like the Face on Mars, when higher quality source images are referenced, this ‘mothership’ is shown to be an optical illusion. The structure is merely a long hill on the lunar surface, which when in deep shadow appears to resemble a cylindrical object.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/martian-hill.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A better quality image of the anomaly show it to be a Martian hill</div></figcaption></figure><p>With Rutledge’s alien spacecraft vanished into dust, much of his story disappears with it. How could the crew of Apollo 20 have explored a spaceship that does not exist?</p><p>Showing that the ‘spacecraft’ in the photographs is simply a hill does not prove Apollo 20 never flew, but if it did its mission as stated by Rutledge is a deception.</p><p>Could the spacecraft story be deliberate misinformation to hide Apollo 20's real mission in a cloak of absurd sounding science fiction? Or did the apocryphal mission never even get off the ground?</p><h3>The elephant in the room</h3><p>The American’s mammoth Saturn V rocket remains the only vehicle ever developed that was capable of taking a payload further than low-earth orbit. As such, all of the Apollo moon missions were launched using Saturn V rockets.</p><p>Between 1966 and 73, 13 of the rockets were successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center, twelve of them for Apollo and one for SkyLab. A further two were constructed but never used and are now on display in museums and space centers across America.</p><p>This presents a serious problem for William Rutledge’s story about a secret Apollo 20 mission. Since the Saturn V was the only rocket capable of propelling a payload beyond Earth orbit, and since all of the known Saturn V rockets are accounted for, how did Apollo 20 even leave the Earth?</p><p>In order for the Apollo 20 mission to have occurred, we have to propose either the USA had built more Saturn V rockets in secret or that they or the Soviet Union had developed other completely unknown rocket technologies that were capable of sending men to the Moon.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/saturn-v-rocket.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">It is unlikely a Saturn V launch could be kept secret</div></figcaption></figure><p>Construction of the Saturn V was a massive effort involving tens of thousands of engineers, designers, scientists and contractors all around the world. The rocket was also vastly expensive, each one cost over $3 billion dollars — so expensive that the cost was one of the main reasons the Apollo program was canceled by President Nixon.</p><p>After construction, the next challenge was the logistics of storing and transporting something so huge. Specialists buildings and vehicles had to be designed, and the moving of the rocket to the launch site involved thousands of people.</p><p>Even if it was possible to keep all of this completely secret, the real problem is the launch itself. According to Rutledge, Apollo 20 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force base, an installation that is located close to several large towns and cities in Santa Barbara. There is even a public rail line that runs right alongside the base.</p><p>The launch of any rocket, let alone something as huge as a Saturn V, would be visible for hundreds of miles around, unmissable to hundreds of thousands of people throughout Southern California. Civil aviation and air traffic control would have to be notified, as would numerous other public bodies.</p><p>It would essentially be impossible for a secret launch to have occurred from Vandenberg, all but confirming the Apollo 20 story as a hoax. A confirmation that would soon come from the hoaxer himself.</p><h3>The art of deception</h3><p>French sculptor Thierry Speth claimed responsibility for the Apollo 20 hoax on an internet bulletin board in 2007. Speth’s use of the username retiredafb elsewhere on the internet was also exposed by several researchers.</p><p>Although Speth admitted the videos were a hoax, this has not deterred posters on websites and internet forums propagating the videos as genuine, either unaware of Speth’s admission or choosing to ignore it.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/moon-city-bruce-pennington.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The moon city in the videos is a composite of NASA photos and the artwork of Bruce Pennington</div></figcaption></figure><p>One line of reasoning has it that Speth’s confession is itself a hoax, simply an attempt at damage limitation or misinformation from NASA. But a closer look at the videos Speth posted under the pseudonym of William Rutledge show the clear fingerprints of fakery.</p><p>Since the hoaxers were obviously unable to produce their own footage of the Moon, they had no alternative but to use existing NASA photos of the lunar surface in order to create their footage, a fact which makes the task of producing undetectable fakes virtually impossible.</p><p>Several of the shots of the Moon’s surface used in the videos are unmistakably composites using such NASA photographs with fictional elements added by the hoaxers.</p><p>One of the film’s most striking sequences was created in this way. The panning shot showing what appears to be a vast alien city on the lunar surface is actually a digital composite created from an Apollo 17 moon photo combined with a painting of alien landscape by artist Bruce Pennington.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/spacecraft-model-apollo-20.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The spacecraft shown in the videos is a model</div></figcaption></figure><p>The next sequence in the videos showing the alien mothership look very much like they were filmed using models, with the wobbly looking flyover of the craft been perhaps the least convincing part of the whole film.</p><p>Thierry Speth is a sculptor by trade, and he appears to have put his talents to good use in creating the ‘Mona Lisa’ alien body. Indeed, several of the artworks shown on his website have a strong resemblance to the body seen in the videos.</p><p>As beguiling as she seems, Mona Lisa is in all likelihood a clay sculpture, created by Speth as the centrepiece of his hoax. She bares all the hallmarks of the artist’s previous works and whilst very artfully designed, does not convince as a real body in most of the shots in the video.</p><p>The cavalier attitude towards the alien body is also giveaway as to its unreality. No quarantine protocols are evident, and the unqualified astronauts perform crude medical procedures on the alien that clearly would never be allowed in a real NASA mission.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/apollo-20-journey-into-darkness/alien-body-model-apollo20-thierry-speth.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The alien body is very similar to artist Thierry Speth’s other sculptures</div></figcaption></figure><p>There’s no doubt that the tale of Apollo 20 and its secret mission to investigate aliens on the Moon is a fantastic story.

There were at least three wounds to Kennedy.

Arlen Specter, an ambitious junior counsel to the Warren Commission,  devised the now notorious single bullet theory to explain all of these wounds.</p><p>Backed into a corner, Spector theorised that the second bullet hit Kennedy in the upper back, passed out through his neck and went on to cause a further five separate wounds to Connally.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/warren-commission-single-bullet.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Warren Commission lied about the location of the wounds</div></figcaption></figure><p>Yet everyone present at the autopsy on the night of the assassination was certain the wound in the President’s back was shallow and did not transit the body.

His wife Nellie, sat next to him in the car, affirmed this.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/magic-bullet-test-comparison.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Test bullets fired at bones showed far more damage than CE399</div></figcaption></figure><p>The evidence against the single bullet theory continued to stack up ; a shot through Kennedy’s neck would have shattered his spine , which was, in fact, undamaged.</p><p>The bullet said to have caused all the damage , Commission Exhibit 399, was allegedly found on a stretcher at Parkland hospital. Yet it was virtually undamaged despite having supposedly shattered Connally’s rib and wrist.</p><p>The Warren Commission’s own ballistics test showed it was impossible for the bullet to have done the amount of damaged claimed without becoming substantially deformed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/president-kennedy-governor-connally.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kennedy and Connally just minutes before the shooting</div></figcaption></figure><p>Dr Joseph Dolce, the senior expert in wound ballistics who performed the tests later said  -  \"The bullet could not have caused so much damage and remained virtually intact; one bullet striking the President’s neck, the Governor’s chest and wrist, should be badly deformed, as our experiments at the Edgewood Arsenal proved.\"</p><p>Despite many attempts to replicate the single bullet shot in tendentious TV specials over the years, nobody has ever come close to convincingly doing so.</p><p>There was a timing problem with the Commission’s theory too. The 8mm home movie of the assassination taken by Dallas dressmaker Abraham Zapruder clearly showed the president reacting to a bullet strike before Connally, despite the fact they were meant to have been hit with the same shot.</p><p>The Zapruder film presented a further problem to the Commission’s shooting pattern when it showed there was a five-second gap between their supposed second and third shots. However, virtually everyone in Dealey Plaza was certain the last two shots they heard were actually very closely bunched together.</p><p>The single bullet theory did not add up, but without it the Warren Commission were unable to demonstrate only three shots were fired and Oswald was the lone assassin.</p><h3>The Paraffin Test</h3><p>A simple paraffin test was administered to Oswald’s cheek after his arrest, which tested negative for gunshot residue.</p><p>Unhappy with the result, the FBI submitted the cast to a whole array of more advanced tests, including neutron activation analysis, all of which returned negative. This was so problematic for the official case that the FBI simply lied about it at the Warren Commission’s hearings.</p><p>This evidence does have some caveats, as the test was not administered until some hours after Oswald’s arrest, but it is still strongly suggestive of his innocence.</p><h3>Oswald’s involvement with the intelligence services</h3><p>Oswald’s life is replete with mysteries and inexplicable events. Far from being a disaffected communist sympathizing loner, Oswald continually associated with right-wingers and members of various intelligence agencies, including the FBI and the CIA.</p><p>Strange facts surrounding Oswald’s defection to the USSR in 1959, and the way he so easily returned to the USA in 1962, are indicative of his involvement in an intelligence operation, as is his fluency in Russian.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/oswald-in-russia.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Oswald lived the high life in Russia — was he on a CIA mission?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Oswald, who threatened to give away US radar secrets when he defected to Russia, was allowed to freely re-enter America two and a half years later without any consequences at all. The CIA even claimed not to have interviewed him on his return, despite it being standard procedure.</p><p>Several investigators have suggested Oswald was a false defector, sent to Soviet Union as part of a CIA intelligence operation. His remarkable fluency in the language, so good several natives mistook Oswald for Russian, certainly suggest official training.</p><p>In New Orleans in the summer of 1963, Oswald was seen in the presence of individuals involved in counter-intelligence operations and appeared himself to be involved in agent provocateur activity against the Fair Play For Cuba Committee.</p><p>Oswald set up a fake one-man chapter of the FPCC and started handing out pro-Castro leaflets in the high street. On one occasion he was even arrested after getting into a scuffle with anti-Castro protesters.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/oswald-leaflets-new-orleans.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Oswald handing out FPCC leaflets in New Orleans</div></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, Guy Banister, a local private investigator, was working with the FBI as part of their cointelpro program against the FPCC.</p><p>It seems very likely Banister was using Oswald as part of a propaganda operation against the FPCC;  the pair were seen together by several witnesses and Oswald’s leaflets were stamped with an address in the same building as Banister’s office.</p><p>Once we accept the possibility that Oswald was involved in cointelpro, other mysteries about him take on a new light.</p><p>The famous photographs of him holding a pistol and rifle in his backyard, far from fakes, look for all the world like Oswald’s attempt at creating false credentials for himself as an extremist in order to use as leverage to infiltrate the kind of far left wing groups the FBI were targeting with cointelpro.</p><h3>Mexico City</h3><p>Shortly before the assassination, Oswald was involved,  either knowingly or not, in a complex intelligence operation in Mexico City where he was impersonated on at least one occasion.</p><p>Oswald supposedly travelled to Mexico City in late September 1963 to try and obtain a visa to travel back to the Soviet Union. He visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies on multiple occasions and also made several phone calls to the embassies.</p><p>However, despite extensive camera surveillance of both buildings, the CIA were unable to provide any photographic evidence of Oswald’s presence at either embassy, claiming the cameras weren’t operating or the photos were destroyed. The HSCA later discovered the CIA had lied about both points.</p><p>Photos did later emerge, but none of them showed the real Oswald. Six weeks later, on the night of the assassination, FBI agents questioning the alleged assassin made a startling discovery. They had obtained tapes of Oswald’s calls to the Cuban embassy and the voice on the tape was not him.</p><blockquote><span>\"...it appears that there is a second person who was at the Soviet embassy down there.\"</span><br><cite>J. Edgar Hoover</cite></blockquote><p>Hoover summed up the situation in a phone called to new President Lyndon Johnson . \"We have up here the tape and the photograph of the man who was at the Soviet embassy using Oswald’s name…that picture and the tape do not correspond to this man’s voice, nor to his appearance. In other words, it appears that there is a second person who was at the Soviet embassy down there.\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/lyndon-b-johnson.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">New President Lyndon B.

Despite extensive rumours about Ruby’s links to organised crime, the Warren Commission entirely dismissed any links and concluded Ruby was a lone nut who murdered Oswald because he was upset about Jackie Kennedy’s suffering.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/oswald-shot-by-ruby.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Lee Harvey Oswald murdered live on TV by Jack Ruby.</div></figcaption></figure><p>They also dismissed any suggestion he had help gaining access to the Dallas police station basement. 15 years later the HSCA sternly rebuked the Warren Commission over their conclusions about Ruby.</p><p>Ruby had, in fact, numerous connections to organised crime. And his association with organised crime figures massively ramped up in the months leading up to Kennedy’s assassination, his out of state phones calls alone peaked at a twenty-five fold increase on normal levels in the weeks before November 22nd.</p><p>The HSCA also concluded, contrary to the Warren Commission’s verdict, that Ruby probably had inside help in gaining access to the Dallas Police station basement.</p><p>Ruby himself lent credence to conspiracy rumours when he made enigmatic comments in a brief televised news conference in 1965.</p><p>\"Everything pertaining to what’s happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I’m in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world.\"</p><p>When asked by a reporter - \"Are these people in very high positions, Jack?\", Ruby responded - \"Yes.\"</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Oswald’s behaviour</h3><p>Oswald immediately fled the Texas School Book depository after the assassination, an action which some have suggested indicates a guilty mind.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas/oswald-texas-theatre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Oswald captured at the Texas Theatre</div></figcaption></figure><p>Oswald rushed to his rooming house to retrieve a revolver and was later captured in the Texas Theatre after a scuffle with police officers. These actions certainly appear to indicate some kind of guilt on the part of Oswald.</p><p>However, as with much of the evidence against Oswald, there are other explanations for his actions. For instance, Oswald may have fled the scene because he realised he had been set up and feared for his life.</p><h3>The Rifle</h3><p>The Warren Commission presented much evidence that appeared to show Oswald had ordered the rifle which was linked to the assassination, an old WW2 era Italian Mannlicher Carcano.</p><p>Oswald allegedly ordered the rifle from a mail order firm using an alias Alek J. Hidell and much later a partial palm print was found on the weapon which matches the accused assassin.</p><p>The evidence appears convincing, but as with all aspects of this case, there are some caveats. There are several curious anomalies in the chain of evidence presented that might have been successfully exploited by Oswald’s defence if the case had ever gone to trial.</p><p>The order form for the rifle was posted at a time when Oswald was known to be at work. There are even timesheets to prove it.</p><p>He also had the weapon delivered to a PO Box registered under his real name, yet ordered the rifle under a pseudonym. This would have been illegal in 1963 and he should not have been allowed to take delivery of the package.</p><p>Despite these problems, the rifle evidence remains perhaps the most convincing part of the official case against Oswald.</p>","tile":"assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas","path":"assassination-of-jfk-conspiracy-in-dallas","date":"2019-11-08T17:39:30.684Z","formatteddate":"Nov 8, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Assassination of JFK","subheadline":"Conspiracy <span>in Dallas</span>","snippet":"Was there a conspiracy to murder President John F.

RFK himself was shot 3 times with a 4th shot entering his clothing, and 5 other bystanders in the kitchen were also shot — Paul Schrade, Ira Goldstein — twice, Erwin Stroll, William Weisel and Elizabeth Evans.</p><p>Already Sirhan’s 8 shot revolver looked insufficient to account for all the wounds.</p><p>Aside from the wounds, there were also several bullet holes observed in both the ceiling tiles and the walls of the Ambassador hotel kitchen.</p><p>Even more troubling was an AP photo that emerged showing two policemen examining a bullet hole in a door frame. The two officers — Sgt. Charles Wright and Sgt.

Could he have been hypnotised?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/assassination-of-rfk-the-second-gunman/manchurian-andidate-1962.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">In The Manchurian Candidate, a man is brainwashed into assassinating a presidential candidate</div></figcaption></figure><p>Although no firm evidence has emerged, Bill Bryan, an eccentric figure involved in CIA hypnosis and a researcher in their MK-Ultra mind control program, has been accused by some authors of inducing Sirhan into firing at Kennedy.</p><p>Bryan was known to have bragged that he was a consultant on the Manchurian Candidate — a film whose plot centered on a man hypnotised to kill a Presidential candidate.</p><p>Investigators also discovered he had been telling prostitutes that he had programmed Sirhan.

Arshad Sharif, 26, another computer scientist who worked on satellite guidance systems at Marconi died in the oddest circumstances imaginable.</p><p>Sharif also travelled to Bristol, tied one end of a ligature to his neck, the other end to a tree, then jammed his foot on the accelerator of his car and decapitated himself.</p><p>The day before his death, Sharif had been acting oddly and was seen paying for accommodation in a rooming house with a bundle of high denomination bank notes.</p><p>A relative summoned to identify the body noticed something suspicious about his car. What appeared to be a metal rod was lying on the floor of the car next to the accelerator.

Indeed, nobody at the time made any connection.</p><p>But moving into 1987 and 1988, the pace of deaths massively increased, and the UK press and some MPs began to join the dots.</p><h3>The cluster of 87–88</h3><p>1987 started with the death of Richard Pugh. Another computer expert in the defence industry and consultant to the MOD, Pugh’s body was found in his flat — his feet bound, a plastic bag on his head and a thick rope coiled around his body.

Having spent an evening with friends, he and his wife returned home and Peapell went to put away the car.</p><p>The next morning his wife found his body jammed underneath the car with his mouth next to the exhaust pipe. Police were unconvinced it was suicide because it seemed impossible he could have manoeuvred his body into the odd position it was found. An open verdict was ultimately returned.</p><p>John Whiteman supposedly drowned himself in his bathtub, the body surrounded by pills and empty alcohol bottles. Yet the autopsy revealed no trace of drugs or alcohol in his body.</p><p>In March, David Sands, a senior scientists working on computer-controlled radar at a Marconi sister company, made a sudden u-turn in his car and crashed at high speed into an empty cafe.</p><p>His vehicle was inexplicably loaded up with cans of petrol, causing the car to be completely consumed by a fireball. Sands was only identified with reference to his dental records.</p><p>In April, in almost identical fashion to Richard Pugh at the start of 1987, Mark Wisner, 24, was found dead with a plastic bag on his head and clingfilm wrapped around his face. The verdict was death by sexual misadventure.</p><p>The previous year Marconi purchased defence electronics firm Plessey. Within a month between May and June 1987 two of its scientists were dead — Michael Baker, 22 in May and Frank Jennings, 60, in June.</p><p>At the start of 1988, lab technician Russel Smith, 23, jumped off a cliff in Cornwall. A senior computer engineer at Marconi — Trevor Knight, was the victim of yet another suicide by car exhaust pipe.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dead-scientists-the-marconi-murders/marconi-deaths-pleasey.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Marconi purchased high-tech firm Plessey in 1987. Within a year, two of its scientists were dead</div></figcaption></figure><p>In August, there were two gruesome electrocutions of senior figures at Marconi that are some of the most suspicious of all the deaths.</p><p>Alistair Beckham, 50, was a computer engineer who it’s believed was working on top secret pilot programs for America’s Strategic Defence Initiative.</p><p>After some light Sunday afternoon gardening, Beckham retired to his shed, attached wires to his chest, pushed them into a power socket and, with a handkerchief jammed in his mouth, hit the power.</p><p>Beckham’s wife was entirely unconvinced her husband committed suicide. Beckham was highly secretive about his work and just hours after his death men from the Ministry of Defence arrived at the scene and took away several documents and files from Beckham’s home.</p><p>In similar but even more gruesome fashion, Marconi director John Ferry, 60, jammed stripped wires into his own tooth fillings and electrocuted himself.</p><p>Could all of these grisly suicides really just be a coincidence? By now several stories in the press had appeared questioning whether there was actually some kind of KGB or Eastern bloc conspiracy to kill the scientists.</p><p>Several MPs and trade union leader Clive Jenkins called for an inquiry into the deaths. Jenkin’s wrote that the deaths were — “statistically incredible” and spoke of the concern amongst his members over “these clusters of suicides, violent deaths, or murders.”</p><p>The conservative government of Margaret Thatcher dismissed calls for an inquiry, claiming the deaths were not statistically unusual and were just ‘coincidences’, perhaps exacerbated by high levels of stress in the defence industry.</p><h3>Untypical suicide methods</h3><p>Professor Colin Pritchard, a noted expert in mental illness and suicides, thinks at least some of the deaths were statistically uncommon.</p><p>Whilst it's true suicide is one of the most prevalent causes of early death in men, especially young men, Pritchard believes factors in some of the cases make the suicide verdicts unlikely.</p><p>Pritchard cites the cases of at least four of the men that share unusual elements. They had each complained to friends and family that they had been tasked ‘strange’, ‘impossible’ and ‘unscientific’ tasks by their employers.</p><p>All four committed suicide in incredibly violent and bizarre ways. Pritchard has studied numerous suicide cases and thinks such extreme suicide methods are normally only associated with people suffering severe mental breakdowns, to the extent they would be unable to even hold down jobs.</p><p>Yet the men were all employed up until the day of their deaths and none had shown any sign of mental illness or other disturbance.</p><p>All of the men had also recently found new jobs and were preparing to leave within days of their deaths. Likewise, all 4 men had recently arranged appointments with their MPs.</p><p>What were the strange ‘unscientific’ projects that the men were complaining of, and why had they all booked appointments with their MPs? Had they stumbled on something in their jobs that had worried them — something that led to them been silenced?</p><h3>Sexual misadventure as method of murder</h3><p>Several of the deaths were put down to sex games gone wrong. But intelligence expert Conrad Black says death by sexual misadventure is a common method of disguising murder in the world of espionage.</p><p>Black told the Daily Record — “Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad.</p><p>The sex game cover is a very useful mechanism in a murder. Not only does it provide a disguise for the actual means and method of death, it trashes the reputation of the victim and blunts the energy of any subsequent investigation.”</p><h3>Foreign Sabotage</h3><p>The Marconi deaths weren’t the only unexplained, violent or unusual deaths amongst defence workers in Europe in the 1980s.</p><p>In West Germany in 1986 there were several incidents involving individuals associated with America’s SDI — the Strategic Defence Initiative dubbed ‘Star Wars’ by the press.</p><p>The Strategic Defence Initiative was an ambitious programme to create a space based anti-nuclear weapon shield which would have rendered Soviet nuclear capability useless.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dead-scientists-the-marconi-murders/karl-heinz-beckurts-car-bomb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Karl-Heinz Beckurts was killed by a car bomb in 1986</div></figcaption></figure><p>In July, Karl-Heinz Beckurts, a director at Siemens and an SDI contractor was killed by a car bomb in Munich.</p><p>Later in ‘86, Gerrold von Bruanmuhl, a senior advisor in SDI negotiations was killed. There were other attacks on firms related to SDI and German prosecutors believed they were been targeted.</p><p>Similar deaths and disappearances amongst defence figures in Sweden and Italy occurred at the same time, giving rise to the suspicion that there was an Eastern Bloc plot to attack Western defence capability and the SDI.</p><p>Attempting to undermine an enemy’s defence capabilities by murdering their scientists is not uncommon. The US, UK and Israel have all been known to strategically stage accidents to remove high-ranking enemy scientists for political ends.</p><blockquote><span>\"Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad\"</span><br><cite>Conrad Black</cite></blockquote><p>In recent years at least 4 top Iranian nuclear scientist have been killed by Israel’s Mossad in an attempt to derail Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>Killing targets in a foreign country is also not uncommon.

The remains found in the basement of the Crippens house were missing the head, limbs and skeleton. Why had Crippen gone to the trouble of dismembering and disposing of his wife’s body elsewhere only to leave part of it in his own home?</p><p>These curiosities aside, it wasn't until 2007 that a serious challenge to the longstanding belief in Crippen’s guilt emerged. Like most people, forensic toxicologist John Trestrail had heard the name Dr Crippen, but it wasn't until he learnt of the details of the case that alarm bells started to ring.</p><p>Cora Crippen's murder contained one feature so unusual that Trestrail had never encountered it before in over 20 years of practise. According to the prosecution pathologist Bernard Spilsbury, the cause of death was poison, yet Crippen was also accused of dismembering the body.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-le-petite-parisienne-1910.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Crippen’s execution as depicted in a French magazine</div></figcaption></figure><p>For Trestrail, this made no sense. Murderers invariably chose poison to kill their victims because they want to pass the death off as natural or an accident. So why dismember the body?</p><p>Trestrail’s investigation pushed Crippen’s descendants to commission new tests on the piece of tissue Spilsbury had used to identify the body. The results were a bombshell - the DNA extracted from the remains was not from Cora.</p><p>Was Dr Crippen, a man whose name has become synonymous with murder, innocent after all?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Inexplicable Dr Crippen</h3><p>For forensic toxicologist John Trestrail, the Crippen case was an anomaly. As a veteran of hundreds of FBI cases, and the author of standard textbooks on the subject, Crippen’s mutilation of a victim he had also poisoned was something he had never seen before.</p><p>\"A poisoner wants the death to appear natural so he can get a death certificate. This is the only case I know of where the victim was dismembered. It doesn't make sense.\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-cellar-body.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The remains were found in the cellar of Crippen’s house at Hilldrop Crescent</div></figcaption></figure><p>If Crippen was the culprit, then he had essentially filleted his wife’s body, leaving nothing but a tangled mess of flesh and skin hidden beneath a slab in his cellar. Gone entirely were Cora’s head, limbs, skeleton and sex organs.</p><p>The grisly treatment of Cora’s corpse raises the obvious question as to whether someone as timid as Crippen could have done something so horrific. But more crucially, why did he?</p><p>Having successfully disposed of the majority of his wife’s body, indeed none of the other body parts have ever been found, why did Crippen leave these small scraps wrapped up in a pair of pyjamas where they would surely be discovered?</p><p>The strangeness of this behaviour has led some to speculate that Crippen was framed by the police, although there appears little other evidence or even motive for this to be the case. Clearly if Cora had later turned up alive, it would have been incredibly damaging for Spilsbury and the police to have staked their reputation on the belief that she was buried in Crippen’s cellar.</p><p>Those remains did contain a piece of skin featuring what Spilsbury identified as a surgery scar.  This scar was found to be consistent with a 4 inch scar Cora had from an operation on her abdomen some years previously.</p><p>In the pre-CSI era and to a jury unused to forensic evidence, Spilsbury's findings looked incredibly persuasive, so much so that it took them just 27 minutes to return a guilty verdict at the trial.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/bernard-spilsbury.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Legendary forensic pathologist Bernard Spilsbury was central to the case against Crippen</div></figcaption></figure><p>Spilsbury was a brilliant man whose findings during his lifetime were rarely challenged. However, working with primitive equipment at the infancy of forensics, some of his conclusions look somewhat less impressive to modern eyes.</p><p>A modern day forensic scientist, David Foran of Michigan State University, believes Spilsbury was overreaching in his evidence at the Crippen trial and the ‘surgery scar’ was nothing more than a fold of skin, something the defense at the trial had argued to little avail.</p><p>Foran believes the marks on the skin are simply natural folds because of the visible hair follicles present on the surface, something that would not be the case if it was scar tissue.</p><p>Trestrail was also sceptical about the poison Crippen was supposed to have used, a common sedative and depressant named hyoscine that he’d never seen used in any other poisoning case in the literature.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-trial-courtroom-sketch.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The press closely followed the trial</div></figcaption></figure><p>With hyoscine so rare in poisoning cases and toxicology still primitive in 1910, Trestrail believes the prosecution's team would not even have searched for, let alone found the presence of the drug in the remains.</p><p>Several theories have been posited about the presence of hyoscine in the body recovered from Crippen's cellar. Renowned barrister Edward Marshall Hall thought Crippen may have been using hyoscine on his wife as a sexual depressant, due to her promiscuity, and had accidentally given her an overdose.</p><p>If the theory is true, it still leaves us with the conundrum of why Crippen had disposed of his wife's body in two locations, electing to leave lumps of flesh in his own cellar. Nobody has ever provided a convincing motive for Crippen’s actions in this regard, and it remains a tantalising mystery at the heart of the case.</p><h3>DNA</h3><p>Whilst the evidence used to convict Dr Crippen at his trial now looks speculative at best, Trestrail’s trump card is something undreamt of in the days of Bernard Spilsbury - DNA.</p><p>Spurred on by his investigation, Trestrail enlisted forensic biologist David Foran to conduct DNA tests on a sample of skin tissue preserved from Spilsbury's original 1910 slides at the Royal London Hospital.</p><p>Trestrail had used genealogists to meticulously unravel Cora Crippen's convoluted family tree in the hope of finding modern day relatives, and eventually found Marie Hamel, a 64 year Californian living quietly in a suburb of Los Angeles.</p><p>Foran’s team at the forensic biology lab at Michigan State University compared a DNA swab provided by Hamel against DNA from the century old Royal hospital samples only to come to a startling conclusion that threatened to turn one of crimes most famous cases on its head.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-film-1960-donald-pleasence.jpg?-i4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Donald Pleasence in the 1962 film Dr. Crippen</div></figcaption></figure><p>The skin Spilsbury had used all those years ago to send Dr Crippen to the gallows was not from Cora Crippen. In fact, the DNA wasn't even female. With one fell swoop both the central case against Crippen - that he had murdered his wife, and rumours that he may have been conducting illegal backstreet abortions, crumbled.</p><p>Foran’s results have come under fire but he stands firm against criticism that the samples were too old to reliably test. \"A slide in a museum is a pretty nice way to preserve DNA. Compare that to bones that have been in the ground for thousands of years.\" He stated, \"There was a lot more DNA work that showed unequivocally that the remains were male”.</p><p>Other critics believe that the modern day relatives of Cora may not actually be blood relations, thus nullifying the results, although this is something denied by Marie Hamel, who is the granddaughter of Cora’s half-sister Bertha Mersinger.</p><p>Assuming the DNA findings are correct, the results have led to speculation that Crippen may have murdered one of Cora’s lovers or even that he was some undiscovered Edwardian serial killer.</p><p>Whatever the truth, the DNA evidence suggested that even if Crippen had killed Cora, he had not buried her remains at Hilldrop Crescent.</p><h3>Suppressed Evidence</h3><p>In light of the circumstantial evidence against him, and with such an obvious motive for murder, Crippen’s explanation for his wife's disappearance always looked unbelievable.</p><p>However, some tantalizing hints do exist that suggests the possibility he was telling the truth. Most of these were suppressed at the trial for fear they might damage the case against the Doctor, but have been rediscovered over the years by researchers into the enduring case.</p><p>One statement obtained by the police, not used at the trial, was from a cab driver who testified that two weeks before Cora’s disappearance he had helped a woman matching her description carry six steamer trunks from the house at Hilldrop Crescent.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/detective-walter-dew.jpg?-i4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Detective Walter Dew pursued Crippen across the Atlantic</div></figcaption></figure><p>Similar evidence that around the same time Cora may have tried to withdraw a large sum of money from the Crippen deposit account was also not followed up.</p><p>Several letters were sent to Crippen at Pentonville prison from a woman claiming to be Cora, one stating “I don't want to be responsible for your demise if I can save you in this way, but I will never come forward personally, as I am happy now.”</p><p>Whilst it’s generally thought these letters are hoaxes, an all too common hindrance in many high profile criminal case, they were never passed on to Crippen’s defense and so were not investigated further to determine their provenance.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>A Guilty Mind</h3><p>If the forensic case against Dr Crippen now looks decidedly unsound, the circumstantial one remains as strong as ever. Crippen’s lies, suspicious behavior, his flight from justice and his refusal to talk are all redolent of some kind of guilt. But was it of his wife’s murder?</p><p>Shortly after Cora’s disappearance had become noticed, Crippen started to claim that his wife had returned to the United States. He would later write to her friends saying that Cora had unfortunately been taken ill and passed away.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-ethel-arrested-quebec.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Dr Crippen and Ethel Le Neve escorted back to the UK by detectives</div></figcaption></figure><p>This naturally aroused suspicion. Why had Cora not written to her friends herself, or told them she was returning to America? Suspicion only grew when Crippen moved his mistress Ethel Le Neve into his house, and she begun to openly wear Cora’s clothing and jewelry.</p><p>After a few weeks had passed, and the whispers about Crippen had become louder, Chief Inspector Dew of the Metropolitan Police called by to question the Doctor about his wife's absence.</p><p>Crippen admitted to Dew that he had made up the entire story about his wife’s death out of embarrassment because she had in fact eloped to Chicago with one of her lovers from the music hall.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/ethel-le-neve.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Crippen’s young mistress Ethel Le Neve moved into the Crippen’s home after Cora’s disappearance</div></figcaption></figure><p>Having made Dew his confidente about this delicate matter, the Detective was inclined to believe Crippen. A subsequent search of the house revealed nothing and Dew elected to drop the matter.</p><p>What Hawley Crippen did next did not look like the actions of an innocent man. Scenting that the police may not believe him, he and Ethel fled the country, taking the ferry to Brussels before moving on to Antwerp where they boarded the SS Montrose for their ill fated voyage to Canada.</p><p>Would a man entirely innocent of wrongdoing really have upturned his whole life to become a fugitive? It's impossible to know what was going on in Crippen’s mind at this time, but his actions almost look tantamount to a confession.</p><p>The case against Dr Crippen looked open-and-shut. Shortly after his wife vanished without trace, body parts are found in his cellar. At the first sign of the police, he fled the country. Any prosecution would have successfully won the case against him on circumstantial evidence alone.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/wireless-telegraph-crippen.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Crippen was the first criminal caught with the use of a the wireless telegraph</div></figcaption></figure><p>For their part, Crippen’s defense attempted to argue the human remains had predated their client’s residence at Hilldrop Crescent, and must have been deposited there by a previous tenant. However, the prosecution would soon thwart Crippen's last chance of escaping the gallows.</p><h3>Traces of Cora</h3><p>Crippen’s trial at the old Bailey lasted just five days. Faced with a barrage of damning evidence against their client, the defense countered with the argument that the body buried under the coal cellar was not Cora and had been left there before the couple had moved into the house.</p><p>This line of defense looked futile from the off. Hawley and Cora Crippen had moved into the house at Hilldrop Crescent in 1905, and the body was discovered in 1910. Could the couple really have lived there for more than five years unaware that a putrefying corpse was buried in a shallow grave in their ground floor coal cellar?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/cora-pygamas.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The remains were found wrapped in these pyjamas</div></figcaption></figure><p>Crippen’s hopes were comprehensively dashed when fragments of a pyjama top found amongst the flesh was traced back to a local firm of shirtmakers from the still intact label which read ‘Jones Bros (Holloway) Ltd’.</p><p>An employee from the firm was called to testify who confirmed to the courtroom that Jones Bros had not become a limited company until 1906, the year after Crippen had moved into the house. This put to bed any doubt that whoever was buried in the cellar had been put there before Crippen was a resident.</p><p>But in order to be sure of the conviction, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was specifically Cora, and not some other unfortunate who had somehow met a grim fate in the Crippen cellar.</p><p>The scar Bernard Spilsbury had found on a piece of skin was the most obvious connection, matching as it did a surgery scar Cora was known to have. Also strewn amongst the remains were three Hindes hair curlers of the type Cora was known to use, wrapped in brownish blond hair that matched the Doctor’s missing wife.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/crippen-hair-with-clips.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Curls of hair found amongst the remains were similar to Cora’s</div></figcaption></figure><p>To round off the case against Crippen, the prosecution produced evidence from an Oxford Street chemist that Crippen had purchased a large quantity of the drug hyoscine - he claimed as an ingredient for his homemade patent medicines, a fortnight before Cora’s disappearance. This was the very toxic substance prosecution toxicologist William Wilcox had detected in the remains from the coal cellar.</p><p>Given the weight of evidence against him, the jury at the trial really had little choice but to send Crippen to the gallows. Back in 1910 the criminal justice system enacted it’s verdicts with startling haste, and just a month after his sentencing Crippen was hung.</p><p>Ethel Le Neve was tried separately and acquitted of been an accessory after the fact, after which she emigrated to America and disappeared from the public eye. The case, however, has never left the public conscience and even inspired a popular song of the era:</p><p>Whether Dr. Crippen deserves his reputation as one of history's most notorious murders is debatable. The case may have become one of countless obscure domestic murders if not for the novelty of Crippen’s capture and the gruesome nature of the crime.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-crippen-murder-chamber-of-horror/hawley-harvey-crippen.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The enigmatic Hawley Harvey Crippen</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Doctor’s presence amongst other infamous murderers in the chilling Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussauds, and his depiction in fiction have also done much to secure his place in the public imagination.</p><p>Today, modern forensics has raised serious doubts about the identity of the victim in the coal cellar.

The official verdict was that he had died due to a self-inflicted injury to the ulnar artery and an overdose of his wife’s co-proxamol tablets.</p><p>Many medical professionals disagreed. In a series of letters to the national press, a number of concerned doctors disputed the official verdict. They felt the injuries to Kelly could not cause his death.</p><blockquote><span>\"I have never seen one death of somebody from cutting an ulnar artery.\"</span><br><cite>Dr Bill McQuillan</cite></blockquote><p>They pointed out people rarely die by wrist cutting. The arteries immediately begin to close up and constrict the blood loss. Dr Bill McQuillan, who had dealt with hundreds of wrist accidents said — “I have never seen one death of somebody from cutting an ulnar artery.”</p><p>The choice of the ulnar artery was particularly odd. The ulnar artery is deeper in the wrist and covered by nerves and tendons, which would require considerable force to cut. Why would Kelly choose that rather than the easy to access radial artery?</p><p>Nor could the painkillers have caused his death. The levels of the drug found in his stomach and bloodstream were much too low to have killed Kelly. 3 empty blister packs were found on Kelly’s body, but this was no proof of ingestion.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-david-kelly-many-dark-actors/david-kelly-pills.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kelly supposedly had trouble swallowing pills</div></figcaption></figure><p>The paramedics agreed with the doctors. David Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the first medical professionals to tend to Kelly were so baffled as to the lack of blood at the scene they went to the press.</p><p>“I’ve seen more blood at a nosebleed than I saw there”, Bartlett said in an interview. The arterial spray should have covered Kelly and the whole area with blood but very little was found.</p><p>“There just wasn’t a lot of blood … When somebody cuts an artery, whether accidentally or intentionally, the blood pumps everywhere”, Hunt said.</p><p>Dr Bill McQuillan concurred. If Kelly has slit his ulnar artery “…his clothes, face and any surrounding structures would show evidence of that with the blood scattered as from a watering can”.</p><p>Some blood was found at the scene, but it takes around 3–4 pints of blood loss for an adult male to die — a huge amount that should have been apparent to all present.</p><h3>Gaps in the evidence</h3><p>According to police reports, various items were found at the scene — a small water bottle, a gardening knife, a painkiller blister pack, his glasses and his watch.</p><p>No fingerprints were found on any of the objects. Whilst it is common to find no identifiable fingerprints on such evidence, to find no prints at all is unusual. No mention of this was made at Hutton.</p><p>The water bottle found near Kelly’s body was still half full. It’s difficult to see how Kelly could have swallowed 29 co-proxamol tablets, as alleged, with such little water.</p><p>Worse still, Hutton failed to mention reports that Kelly suffered from ‘unexplained dysphagia’ a syndrome that makes it difficult for the subject to swallow pills.</p><p>Hutton failed to cover another medical issue. Kelly had fractured his left elbow earlier that year and according to friends was “unable to cut a steak” with his right hand. Why then, would Kelly choose to cut his wrists with his right hand?</p><p>Kelly, an expert in the ‘science of death’ had chosen an unlikely suicide method. Kelly would have been well aware that wrist slitting was unlikely to kill him; it is normally associated with young people and a ‘cry for help’.</p><p>Hutton also glossed over some disturbing details from the autopsy.</p><p>Various scuffs, abrasions and cuts were found, but they were blithely dismissed as been caused by Kelly ‘stumbling’. Could they have been evidence of a struggle with a third party?</p><p>Acetone was found in Kelly’s blood and urine, which may have indicated he died much later than thought — later than 1am. If so, the obvious question is why Kelly would disappear then wait some 8 hours or more to commit suicide?</p><p>These problems with the suicide scenario, along with the improbability of it proving fatal led to a campaign by a group of Doctors to have an official inquest opened into Kelly’s death.</p><h3>Whitewash</h3><p>The Hutton inquiry was set up the day after Kelly’s death and it immediately shut down and superseded the corners inquest.</p><p>Inquests are routinely opened in the case of violent, sudden or suspicious deaths. They are legal bodies that have the power of subpeona and evidence is given under oath.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1484\" height=\"1296\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-david-kelly-many-dark-actors/lord-hutton-whitewash.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Lord Hutton's report was accused of whitewash when it was released in 2004</div></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, the Hutton inquiry had no legal authority, failed to call many key witnesses and no evidence was given under oath. Amazingly, even the head of the police investigation into Kelly’s death was not called to testify.</p><p>This caused disquiet and concern even amongst those who believed Kelly killed himself. Replacing an inquest with a political inquiry was unique in all British legal history.</p><p>Hutton’s subsequent report was widely regarded as a whitewash that was designed from the outset to declare Kelly’s death nothing more than a tragic suicide.</p><p>The suicide scenario was further reinforced in the media by several individuals claiming to have an insight into Kelly’s mental state.</p><p>The most prominent of these was Tom Mangold, a veteran journalist with links to the intelligence services. As soon as lunchtime on the day of Kelly’s death, Mangold began an exhaustive series of tv and newspaper interviews.</p><p>Always described as a ‘close’ or ‘long-time’ friend of Kelly’s, the journalist repeatedly told the media how certain he was Kelly had committed suicide.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/dr-david-kelly-many-dark-actors/dr-david-kelly-happy.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">David Kelly in happier times</div></figcaption></figure><p>As a personal friend, Mangold seemed to have an insight into Kelly’s trouble mind.

Kelly was strictly a contact who he had talked to occasionally regarding stories he was working on.</p><p>Why then, did Mangold bombard the media with interviews claiming to be a close personal friend of Kelly? Why had he told us with such certainty Kelly was suicidal when he hardly knew him?</p><p>Many of Kelly’s own communications at this time, including one where he rebuffs supposed friend Mangold, actually show him to be optimistic and looking forward to getting back to work.</p><p>He was also a hardened UN weapons inspector, used to dealing with intense pressure and confrontation.

The body of a British spy found dead inside a sports bag, its zipper padlocked shut from the outside.</p><p>Incredibly London’s metropolitan police concluded the death was “probably an accident”. Their conclusion overturned an official inquest’s findings that the death was “unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated”.</p><p>This uncertainty highlighted just why this was one of the most perplexing and complex unsolved murders in recent history. A case mired with contradictions and mysteries, obscured by secrets and lies and centering on a man who himself was an enigma.</p><p>That man was 31-year-old Gareth Williams, a brilliant mathematician and codebreaker at the UK’s secret communications monitoring station GCHQ. William’s work, thought to involve cyberterrorism, was classified top secret.</p><p>He was approaching the end of a one-year secondment to MI6, Britain’s foreign security service, when on August 23 his naked, heavily decomposed body was found curled up inside a padlocked red sports holdall in the bath of his top floor flat at an MI6 safe house.</p><p>Unusual features of the crime scene made the police’s job virtually impossible from the start. Even though it was the middle of summer, the heating in the flat had been left on at the highest setting, hastening the decomposition of Williams body and making it impossible for the pathologist to ascertain the cause of death.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/gareth-williams-portrait.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Gareth Williams was not reported missing for over a week</div></figcaption></figure><p>Odder still was the lack of DNA or fingerprints in the bathroom and on the bag. Even if William’s could have somehow locked himself in the holdall, how could he have done so without leaving any forensic traces behind?</p><p>There were no obvious signs he had struggled to release himself from the bag and suicide looked unlikely in the supremely odd circumstances. Detectives were left with the overriding suspicion that Gareth Williams had been murdered.</p><p>A suspicion only deepened by the fact that the front door to Williams’ flat had been locked from the outside, indicating someone else had been at the premises before detectives had arrived. Whoever it was, had they cleaned the crime scene after them?</p><p>The obvious possibility was Williams had been killed by professionals in connection with his top secret work for MI6. But were they enemy agents or his own side? And why had the murder, if it was murder, been staged in such a bizarre fashion?</p><p>For detectives, they were facing a crime straight out of the pages of a Sherlock Holmes story. And in the absence of the great detective, they would have to try and find some answers from Gareth Williams’ employers at MI6.</p><p>Unfortunately, during the course of the subsequent investigation, the security services would consistently thwart attempts by the metropolitan police to properly investigate the crime. Crucial evidence was withheld and William’s colleagues were not allowed to be interviewed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/gareth-williams-cctv.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Gareth Williams pictured on CCTV just days before his death</div></figcaption></figure><p>Some even suspected MI6 of smearing the dead man in the media after lurid stories started to appear in the newspapers, from unknown sources, about Gareth Williams’ private life and his apparent predilection for bondage and transvestitism.</p><p>Whilst £20,000 in women’s clothing and a long red wig were found in his flat, the leaks to the press appeared to be a cynical attempt by someone to steer the story away from murder towards some kind of sex game gone wrong scenario.</p><p>MI6's role in the case became subject to even greater scrutiny when it was discovered that Williams had been missing for more than a week before anybody at his employers reported his absence.</p><p>The idea that someone involved in top secret work vital to the UK’s national security would be allowed to go missing for so long struck many as particularly unbelievable. Could MI6 really be so grossly negligent or did they have something more sinister to hide?</p><p>In May 2012, an official coroner’s inquest fiercely criticised both MI6 and their police liaison SO15 for obstructing the police inquiry and withholding evidence. Their evidence to the inquest, given in secret, was widely regarding as unconvincing.</p><p>But for the coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox, the central issue was still whether Gareth Williams could have locked himself in the bag from the inside. Employing experts in confined spaces, hundreds of attempts to replicate the feat were made without success.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/expert-reconstruction-gareth-williams-bathtub.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Experts tried to reproduce the feat 400 times without success</div></figcaption></figure><p>On this and the balance of other evidence the inquest found William’s death was probably due to “criminal mediated” actions from a third party. As a result, the metropolitan police reopened the case and spent more than a year re-examining the evidence.</p><p>In November 2013, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt told the press that his investigation had, controversially, concluded that Williams’ death was “most probably” an accident, although he also acknowledged the numerous gaps in their knowledge about the case.</p><p>This belated reversal of the inquest’s findings did little to reassure the public or Williams’ family that foul play had not played a part in his death. Lingering questions remain unanswered, including the most important of all.</p><p>Was Gareth Williams murdered?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>The Clean-up</h3><p>Some of the detectives who worked on the case in its early days were convinced the crime scene had been forensically ‘dry-cleaned’, security service jargon for the removal of incriminating evidence such as fingerprints and DNA.</p><p>Former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton was one of the first officers to arrive at the crime scene, “I remain convinced the flat was tidied up after his death”, he told London’s Daily Mail.</p><p>“That may have been to protect national security or it might have been something more sinister. If that’s the case, then it could have been the perfect murder”.</p><p>No fingerprints or DNA other than Williams’ own were found in the flat, although curiously none of this was found in the bathtub in which the body had been found, curled up inside a locked red sports bag.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/gareth-williams-bathroom-dna.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">No fingerprints or DNA were found in the bathroom</div></figcaption></figure><p>William’s body was naked when it was found, so if he had placed himself in the bag, it’s difficult to see how he could have done so without leaving DNA or fingerprints in the bathtub.</p><p>Likewise, no fingerprints or DNA was found on the zipper or the padlock, which Williams would have had to vigorously manipulate in order to lock himself in the bag, and he was not wearing gloves.</p><p>The curious lack of forensic evidence wasn’t the only thing that thwarted detectives investigation. When the police arrived at the flat, they were surprised to discover the heating was in at the maximum setting, despite the fact Williams had died during the middle of a warm summer.</p><p>The excessive heat hastened the decomposition of the body, meaning pathologists were unable to determine the cause of death. Some of the detectives at the scene felt this was another attempt by an unknown third party to destroy evidence, a suspicion also echoed by the coroner.</p><p>One further troubling piece of evidence seemed to confirm the crime scene had been cleaned up. Williams’ phone was laying on a table when his body was discovered, but police found it had been restored to its factory settings just hours before his death.</p><p>At the inquest, coroner Fiona Wilcox was particular concerned by this, suggesting that the phone may have been used to arrange the meeting with Williams’ killers.</p><h3>Harry Houdini</h3><p>So much of this most baffling of cases revolves around the issue of whether Gareth Williams could really have locked himself in the sports bag from the inside.</p><p>To this end, numerous reconstructions were attempted, supervised by two experts in confined spaces, William Mackay and Peter Faulding. Together they made over 400 attempts to try and lock themselves into the same type of red North Face duffel bag in which Gareth Williams’ body was found.</p><p>Neither were able to replicate the feat. “We got close, but close is still far away. That was based upon hundreds and hundreds of attempts, maybe if we had tried it 2,000 times we would have done it, I don’t know, but there were two of us”, Mackay said.</p><p>“I cannot say it is impossible but I think even Houdini would struggle with this one”, Faulding told the inquest. “I believe he was placed in the bag by a third person”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/harry-houdini-escapologist.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The complexities of locking oneself inside of a bag were widely likened to the feats of legendary escapologist Harry Houdini</div></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after the inquest, army sergeant Jim Fetherstonhaugh came forward to claim he had have achieved what had defied the experts. Using a trick employed by airport thieves to steal from locked bags, Fetherstonhaugh was able to successfully demonstrate the technique with his daughter standing in for Williams.</p><p>However, Mackay dismissed the new evidence. “One person did come forward, but the eyelets weren’t put together, in the same way, we dispelled that method as it wasn’t the way that the bag was closed”.</p><p>Perhaps a more prosaic reason to doubt the accident theory is the lack of any signs of a struggle. If Williams had locked himself into the bag as part of a sex game and then found himself trapped, why had he made no attempt to free himself?</p><p>In such a situation, a natural reaction as the survival instinct kicked in would be to struggle with as much violence as could be mustered, yet there were no obvious signs of any damage to the bag or zipper, and Williams himself was curled up inside in a position described as “peaceful”.</p><h3>Secrets and Lies</h3><p>Although the exact nature of Gareth Williams’ work at MI6 has never been revealed, it was known he was an expert codebreaker engaged in top secret work crucial to national security. It has been speculated that his work involved terrorist communications and cyber-warfare.</p><p>On Monday 16th August, a week before his body was found, he was due to chair a meeting with his MI6 colleagues at their headquarters in Vauxhall Cross in London. William’s never turned up and remained absent all week. Astonishingly, nobody at MI6 reported him missing.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/gchq-headquarters.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Williams was a codebreaker at GCHQ, on secondment to MI6 when he died (credit: Ministry of Defence)</div></figcaption></figure><p>It wasn’t until Friday the 20th that his parent employers at GCHQ raised the alarm bells. The human resources department phoned Williams’ line managers at MI6 instructing them to check his flat, and if he could not be found, phone the police.</p><p>Even then, MI6 did nothing. It wasn’t until the following Monday, when GCHQ realised the police still hadn’t been alerted, that that they finally made the call themselves</p><p>“It beggars belief that that is what happened”, said professor Anthony Glees, head of the Buckingham University Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies.</p><p>“It should be stressed that it is standard practice in our secret agencies that if somebody is not at their desk, within an hour a search will be made for their whereabouts”, he added. “Someone working on national security like Gareth Williams does not go missing”.</p><p>The coroners inquest described the extraordinary delay as having “stretched the bounds of credibility” and MI6's conduct was also fiercely criticised by Gareth Williams’ family.</p><p>But despite the security services’ chief Sir John Sawers issuing an apology, no rational explanation has ever been given for the delay. Police detectives were unable to shed any light on the matter due to MI6's unwillingness to allow Williams’ colleagues to be interviewed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/mi6-building-vauxhall-cross.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The MI6 building at Vauxhall Cross in London</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was clear then, the MI6 were engaging in a cover-up over Gareth Williams’ death, but to what purpose? Had he been captured and killed by foreign agents? And were MI6 responsible for the ‘clean-up’ of Williams’ Pimlico flat to conceal the murder?</p><p>It would not be the first time foreign intelligence services had murdered someone in the UK capital. In 1978, Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov was infamously murdered with a poisoned umbrella on Waterloo Bridge, and Alexander Litvinenko was slipped a fatal dose of polonium in a cup of tea at a Mayfair hotel in 2006.</p><p>One security service witness at the inquest, testifying anonymously, did hint darkly that unauthorized searches Williams had made on MI6 computers may have put his safety under threat from hostile third parties, but did not elaborate on who.</p><h3>Smear campaign</h3><p>Almost as soon as the police investigation into Gareth Williams’ death started, so did the leaks. Anonymous stories started to appear in the press about his private life, along with lurid allegations that his death may have had a sexual motive.</p><p>Some stories suggested, on scant evidence, that Williams was gay, a transvestite and into bondage and S&M. Detective Chief Inspector Jackie Sebire, who led the investigation, admitted the leaks had distracted her team from genuine lines of inquiry.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/gareth-williams-flat-crime-scene.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Crime scene photo of Gareth Williams’ flat</div></figcaption></figure><p>Even more malicious rumors also circulated in the press that bondage gear had been found in Williams’ flat, alongside numbers for male escorts. One story even appeared that suggested Williams’ phones had been arranged in a ‘ritualistic’ fashion. All such stories turned out to be entirely untrue.</p><p>At the inquest, coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox ruled out a sexual motive to the murder and stated Gareth Williams was not a transvestite. Wilcox suggested the leaks had been cynical attempts to manipulate the evidence and steer the investigation away from the intelligence services.</p><p>But who was behind the off the record briefings? Were they just rumor mongering or did they have a darker purpose to distract the police from finding the real truth behind Gareth Williams’ strange death?</p><h3>Sex games</h3><p>Former intelligence advisor Crispin Black, who attended the inquest, suggested the ‘sex game gone wrong’ scenario is a favourite method of concealing murder for intelligence agencies.</p><p>“Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad”, he wrote in Scotlands Daily Record.</p><blockquote><span>\"Disposing of an enemy and making it look like a perverted fantasy gone wrong is in the training manuals of every spy agency from MI6 to Mossad\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>“[He] was found dead in a locked bag, in a flat full of women’s clothing and wigs and with his internet browsing history conveniently featuring bondage sites”, Black said.</p><p>“The sex game cover is a very useful mechanism in a murder. Not only does it provide a disguise for the actual means and method of death, it trashes the reputation of the victim and blunts the energy of any subsequent investigation”.</p><p>It is also not the first time suspicions have arisen that GCHQ employees had been murdered in this way. Since 1983, Stephen Drinkwater, Nicholas Husband, 46, and Kevin Allen, 31, have all died in bizarre circumstances that were ruled to be bondage or S&M sex games gone wrong.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>The CSI effect</h3><p>The lack of DNA and fingerprints at the crime scene provoked a tremendous amount of suspicion among detectives and commentators that Williams’ flat had been ‘cleaned up’ by his murderers. But it’s a misconception that forensic evidence is always found at murder scenes.</p><p>Prosecutors call this the ‘CSI effect’. In many modern trials, jurors have become so accustomed to the exaggerated portrayal of forensic science on television shows and films that they expect all cases to revolve around such evidence.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag/dna-evidence.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Juries now expect DNA evidence in all murder cases, but it’s not unusual for none to be found.</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many lawyers in murder cases will call a forensic expert to testify even if there is no forensic evidence in the case, simply because that’s the standard of evidence jurors demand.</p><p>In actual fact, only about 13% of murder cases involve any forensic evidence at all. Usable DNA evidence is only left behind at about 10% of crime scenes.</p><p>Even today, the vast majority of murder cases are still solved with a combination of circumstantial evidence and witness statements, with forensic or DNA evidence playing no part at all.</p><p>So, whilst the absence of handprints and DNA in the bathtub in Gareth Williams’ flat was unusual, it’s certainly not impossible that the combination of heat and moisture in the bathroom could have degraded any such evidence.</p><h3>Predilections</h3><p>Chief Inspector Jackie Sebire, the head of the murder inquiry, and the coroner both dismissed any sexual motive in Gareth Williams death. But some commentators have suggested this may have been a hasty conclusion.</p><p>The coroner’s explanation that the £20,000 in women’s clothing and the red ladies wig found in Williams’ flat were just ‘gifts for friends’ struck many as particularly absurd and unconvincing.</p><p>And although Police experts disputed that this was how it was done in William’s case, a technique was eventually discovered that would allow someone to lock themselves into a bag from the inside.</p><p>Could the bizarre death have been a sex game that went tragically wrong? Some evidence was found by investigators that Williams had shown an interest in bondage, an extreme subset of which is ‘claustrophilia’ the desire to be held in enclosed spaces for sexual gratification.</p><p>A previous landlady of Williams also told the inquest how she had once discovered him tied to his bed wearing only his boxer shorts. Williams had somehow contrived to tie both his hands and feet to the bed-posts, making it impossible to free himself.</p><p>Did this peculiar incident indicate Williams had a past predilection for ‘impossible’ feats of bondage? Or was the truth even stranger?</p><h3>The unsolvable puzzle</h3><p>Of all the theories in this elusive case, one esoteric possibility remains that could perhaps only have been devised by a mathematical genius whose profession it was to break codes.</p><p>Had Gareth Williams set up the whole thing himself? He spent his days solving the most taxing and complex puzzles of cryptography. Did he spend one lonely night devising the most perplexing conundrum of them all — the mystery of the spy in the bag?</p><p>A mystery only a genius detective from the pages of fiction could ever hope to solve.</p>","tile":"gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag","path":"gareth-williams-the-spy-in-the-bag","date":"2018-02-26T20:18:28.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 26, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Gareth Williams","subheadline":"The Spy in <span>the Bag</span>","snippet":"Was an MI6 spy found dead inside a locked sports bag murdered?","tags":["Gareth","Williams","spy","murder","unsolved","mystery","locked","room","MI6","GCHQ","bag","bathroom","death","intelligence","inquest","police"],"title":"Gareth Williams - The Spy in the Bag","tileheadline":"The Spy in the Bag"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeves-superman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">George Reeves was a hero for millions of children</div></figcaption></figure><p>As TV’s original Superman, George Reeves was the ultimate hero to millions of children.

How he came to meet this grisly end is a story as disputed and controversial today as it was when the scandal rocked Hollywood at the height of the actor's fame.</p><p>Tall and chisel jawed, Reeves was the perfect choice to play the all American hero in the syndicated television show the Adventures of Superman. From 1952 to 1958 he starred in 104 episodes, but by the late 50s it had declined in popularity and it was put into hiatus after it’s sixth season.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeeves-superman-death-headline.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Reeves’ shocking death made headlines around the world</div></figcaption></figure><p>Reeves, who took his acting career seriously and had parts in Gone with the Wind and From here to Eternity, always had mixed feelings about his fame as Superman.

However, many of his friends and colleagues believe the actor was murdered, his death the stormy culmination of a tangled love life.</p><p>It was an open secret in the business that Reeves had been conducting a long term affair with Toni Mannix, the wife of notorious Hollywood fixer and MGM vice president Eddie Mannix. They had even planned to marry if Eddie were to die.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/superman-and-the-mole-men2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Superman and the Mole Men acted as a pilot for the TV series</div></figcaption></figure><p>The year before Reeves’ death he abruptly ended his relationship with Mannix, leaving her for the younger New York socialite Leonore Lemmon.

The night Superman died and an enduring mystery was born.</p><p>At around 2am that morning, two police officers arrived at 1579 Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the house Reeves had been living at with his new fiancée Leonore Lemmon during the previous few months. Lemmon had called them after she and her party guests had found Reeves dead in his bedroom.</p><p>Those guests were neighbour Carol Van Ronkel, her lover Robert Condon, and another neighbour, William Bliss. Due to their advanced state of inebriation the party guests were not entirely coherent, but they all seemed to agree on the suicide story. At around 1.20am, a bad tempered Reeves had admonished the trio for their noise, before returning upstairs.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/superman-mole-men.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Reeves as Superman with Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane</div></figcaption></figure><p>What happened next is mired in controversy, but according to the police interviews with the witnesses, a short moment later a shot was heard and the man who had become famous for been impervious to gunfire had, ironically, ended his life with a bullet to the head.</p><p>The subsequent police report seem to accept the whole story at face value. George Reeves was depressed and whilst entertaining guests at his home he he inexplicably left the room, placed a pistol to his right temple and pulled the trigger. It all seemed so simple.</p><p>However, a number of suspicious details about the case have long piqued the interest of gossip mongers and armchair detective alike. Why had Lemmon waited for so long - 45 minutes or so, to call the police? Was it true she was heard to say “He is going to shoot himself”, after Reeves had left the party to go back to bed?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeves-clark-kent.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">George Reeves as Clark Kent in the Adventures of Superman</div></figcaption></figure><p>The police also appeared to be behaving in a careless manner. No photos of the body were taken and the crime scene was not properly searched or dusted for prints. Reeves initially had no autopsy and his body was swifted embalmed.</p><p>The ballistics looked all wrong too. The actor had no burn marks on his hands or face - how had he shot himself in the head with a pistol without leaving powder burns?</p><p>Three bullet holes were found in the bedroom, all caused by the Luger that was found resting between the victim's legs. Had Reeves really shot himself three times? And how had the fatal bullet ended up in the ceiling whilst the shell rested underneath his body?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeves-young.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The young George Reeves was determined to become a serious film actor</div></figcaption></figure><p>Despite these suspicions, the Los Angeles Police Department officially ruled the death a suicide, on little more than a cursory investigation. Were Hollywood's police force keeping a lid on the truth to protect Tinseltown from another scandal? And did that scandal involve one of the most powerful men in the movie business, Toni Maddox’s husband Eddie?</p><p>Perhaps fueled by a disbelief that the Man of Steel could ever take his own life, speculation and theories have abounded for more than 50 years that Lemmon, Mannix, her husband or even a hitman were responsible for the death of Superman.</p><p>Is there any truth in the persistent rumours that Reeves was murdered?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Return of Superman</h3><p>The main reason Reeves was said to have committed suicide was depression over his declining fortunes as an actor. Superman had been cancelled and Reeves had struggled to find the serious work he craved.</p><p>However, friends and relatives think Reeves’ career troubles were exaggerated. In actual fact The Adventures of Superman was due to return in 1960, with a higher pay packet for Reeves and the promise that he would be able to direct more of the episodes, something he had enjoyed doing on the last three shows of the previous season.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeves-superman-publicity.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A publicity shot of George Reeves as Superman</div></figcaption></figure><p>He had also lined up a science fiction script called ‘Return to Earth’, by screenwriter Sidney Fields that he had hoped to direct, possibly with his Superman co-star Phyllis Coates in one of the lead roles. Coates was amongst many of Reeves’ friends and co-stars who did not believe he would have killed himself.</p><p>If anything, it seemed like Reeves career was on the up. Would the actor, generally described as an ordinary, straightforward kind of guy, really have killed himself in a house full of guests, especially choosing to do so naked - highly unusual in suicides?</p><p>George Reeves’ mother Helen Bessolo never accepted the official verdict and hired private investigators to to reopen the investigation into his death. She even commissioned a second autopsy, which concluded that Reeves was possibly murdered. But this had no official status and could not overrule the coroner's verdict of suicide.</p><h3>Faster than a Speeding Bullet</h3><p>Even outside of the world of comic books, bullets sometimes do funny things, and that was certainly the case in the death of George Reeves.</p><p>According to the autopsy report, Reeves had taken his .30 caliber German Luger pistol, placed it near his right temple and pulled the trigger. He died instantly and fell backwards, his feet still hungover the bed and his back on the mattress. The gun fell to his feet and the shell was found underneath him.</p><p>For some reason Reeves had contorted his head so it was tilted upwards at the point of firing, as the bullet was found embedded in the ceiling. If his death was suicide Reeves must have held the gun with his right hand, although this in itself is suspicious as the actor had injured his right hand in an automobile accident a few weeks prior to his death.</p><p>Reeves’ head and hands showed no signs of gunshot residue or powder burns. Even if the actor had not placed the gun to his head at point blank range, as is usual in suicides, it should have left some obvious marks on his forehead.</p><p>Inexplicably, the shell casing was found underneath Reeves’ body. Since a 9mm Luger generally ejects its shells to the right, it's hard to conceive what position the actor must have been in when he fired for it to have ended up underneath him.</p><p>Other evidence that casts doubt on this scenario is the lack of burn marks on Reeves’ back. If he had really fallen backwards onto a freshly ejected shell case it should have been hot enough to have burnt his skin, yet no such marks were evident at the autopsy.</p><p>Had the actor been placed on the bed some time after he was shot? If this was the case, then clearly he had not fired the gun himself, and another party was involved. Further to this, a later search of the bedroom found two extra bullet holes.</p><p>Multiple gunshot suicides are rare, so if these shots were contemporary to Reeves’ death, it seems unlikely he was the shooter. If they were fired earlier, then at the very least its evidence somebody in the house had a somewhat cavalier attitude to firearms.</p><h3>The Fiery Fiancée</h3><p>Leonore Lemmon was, by all accounts, a bit of a hell-raiser. Hard drinking and hard partying, she gave as good as she got, and had the dubious distinction of been the first woman to be thrown out of New York’s famous Stork club for fist fighting. She also had a reputation as a gold digger, having married twice before for money.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/george-reeves-leonore-lemmon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Reeves with his fiancee Leonore Lemmon</div></figcaption></figure><p>Lemmon and Reeves had a stormy relationship but, at least according to her, were engaged to be married. On the night of his death the pair had gone for dinner with writer Richard Condon, who was staying with the couple whilst he worked on a biography of Archie Moore, the prizefighter Reeves had been due to fight in a celebrity boxing match later that year.</p><p>According to Condon, Lemmon was in an combative mood that night, and had made somewhat of a scene in the restaurant. The argument had carried over back to the house, Lemmon apparently upset by the suspicion that Reeves had been talking to previous girlfriend Toni Mannix.</p><p>Years later, William Bliss, one of the party guests who had originally told police Leonore Lemmon was downstairs with them when the shot was heard, changed his story. Talking to friend Millicent Trent, Bliss said Lemmon had actually rushed down the stairs after the gunshot and urged them to “Tell them I was down here! Tell them I was down here!”.</p><p>Was Lemmon with Reeves when he shot himself? Had she even pulled the trigger herself? Considering her temperament, it does not seem out of the question she may have started waving Reeve’s pistol about whilst having a drunken argument with her prospective husband.</p><p>Had Reeves gotten cold feet about their supposed wedding, or been caught on the phone to Toni Mannix? Leonore Lemmon’s behaviour after Reeves’ death did little to allay suspicions she may have had more involvement than she was letting on.</p><p>The police did not treat the house as a crime scene, and Lemmon was able to return shortly after they had left, have the bloody sheets washed, retrieve $4000 in travellers cheques and leave Los Angeles for New York, never to return again, not even for Reeves’ funeral.</p><p>Later in life, she become a somewhat tragic figure, bloated and consumed by alcoholism, Leonore would give many different accounts of the events of that night, often contradicting herself and denying things she was commonly reported to have said and done. She died alone in her apartment over New Year 1989, her body not found for four days.</p><h3>The Jilted Showgirl</h3><p>Mobster Mickey Cohen once described Toni Mannix as the only person in Hollywood who had any balls. So when George Reeves spurned his long term mistress for a younger model, she did not take it lying down.</p><p>Reeves himself was convinced it was Mannix behind a string of strange incidents that had befallen him in the aftermath of their breakup. He was inundated with menacing silent phone calls at all hours of the morning and someone even abducted his beloved dog Sam.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/eddie-toni-mannix.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Toni and Eddie Mannix</div></figcaption></figure><p>Worst of all occurred on April 8th, when Reeves lost control of his Jaguar and careered into a cement pillar near his home in Benedict Canyon. He was lucky to escape with head injuries that required him to take powerful painkillers right up until the night he died.</p><p>The accident was rendered in a more sinister light when Reeves’ mechanic discovered the brake fluid in the car had been drained. Had the usually diligent actor neglected to maintain his prized Jaguar properly or was this, as some have suspected, a murder attempt by Toni Mannix?</p><p>If Mannix was trying to extinguish the Man of Steel, it’s unlikely she pulled the trigger that night at 1579 Benedict Canyon. More adept with withering, foul mouthed put downs, violence was not really her style. Besides, she was married to ‘the most dangerous man in Hollywood’, who had a formidable reputation for been able to make problems disappear.</p><p>Toni, a former showgirl and starlet in the early talkies, married MGM studios enforcer Eddie Mannix in 1951. Shortly after, she began her affair with Reeves, who at 10 years her junior, she referred to as ‘the boy’.</p><p>The Mannix’s relationship was unusual even by the standards of Hollywood. Effectively living an open marriage, Eddie tolerated, even liked Reeves, and himself maintained a younger mistress.</p><p>Eddie’s exploits in covering up the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood were legendary. As portrayed in films such as Hollywoodland and Hail Ceasar, Eddie had an array of thugs, bent cops, private eyes and mobsters on the payroll.</p><p>No scandals were too big to be neutralised by Eddie, from covering-up Clark Gable accidently killing actress Tosca Roulien, to tracking down and buying up every copy of a porn film starring Joan Crawford.</p><p>If anyone could put the heat on Superman it was Eddie. Was he responsible, on behalf of his wronged wife, for the misfortunes that had befallen Reeves in the run up to his death? And was Eddie, a man suspected of killing his first wife Bernice Fitzmaurice, behind the bullet to the head that ended the actors life?</p><p>This theory centres around the mysterious WIlliam Bliss, a stranger to both Reeves and Leonore Lemmon, whose presence in the house that night has never been adequately explained. Was his role to distract the house guests and facilitate the entry of a hitman to do away with Reeves?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/eddie-mannix-josh-brolin-hail-caeser.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Josh Brolin played  Eddie Mannix in the Cohen Brothers’ Hail Caesar</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst highly speculative, some corroboration to this comes from Reeves’ own Lois Lane, actress Phyllis Coates. Coates had become a mutual friend of both her Superman co-star and Tony Mannix. That night she received a disturbing phone call.</p><p>In the early hours of June 16, Mannix called Coates; she was hysterical and told her friend that Reeves had been murdered. This was before news of Reeves death had gotten out, and it always remained a mystery to Coates how Mannix could have known Reeves was murdered unless she was party to it.</p><p>It seems the dark secret haunted her for the rest of her life. According to publicist Edward Lozzi, who had befriended Toni during her last years as a widow in Beverly Hills, what she had done weighed heavily on the now elderly Mannix</p><p>“She was absolutely terrified of going to hell\", Lozzi told the LA Times. In 1983, the publicist sat by her bedside during her last hours, and knowing she was the last person on earth to know the truth, confessed all to her priest.</p><p>She and Eddie had used his underworld connections to have Reeves killed. Her devastation at been rejected by her ‘boy’ had pushed her to the ultimate reprisal.</p><p>Is her confession credible? Clearly she had the motive, and through her ruthless and well connected husband she certainly had the means. But she was also suffering from alzheimer's at the time of her death, and may have confused fact with the many fictions that had long circulated about the death of her former lover.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>The Dark Side</h3><p>While many of Reeves’ friends doubted the suicide verdict, Jack Larson, who played cub reporter Jimmy Olsen in the show, always accepted that his friend took his own life.</p><p>Larson had suffered a similar career downturn to Reeves after series was cancelled, and like his Superman co-star had struggled to break free of the typecasting associated with such an iconic role.</p><p>“Nobody wanted me to work at all. I don't know what happened to George. I was depressed, and I accepted instantly that he had committed suicide”, Larson told Unsolved Mysteries in 1995.</p><p>Larson also thought the prospective return of the Adventures of Superman had filled the actor with dread, “Anyone who thinks another season of Superman wouldn't depress George didn't know George”, he said.</p><p>Reeves would frequently bemoan the role he felt so trapped in, with particular disdain reserved for the crude and repetitive scripts that often required little more of him than to turn up at the end and have the villain’s bullets bounce off his chest.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman/superman-george-reeves-stamp-day.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Towards the end of the TV Show’s run, Reeves had begun to show his age</div></figcaption></figure><p>He referred to the show that had made him famous as “scraping the bottom of the barrel”, and would burn the costume he called a “monkey suit” at the wrap of each season. But unable to find work, perhaps George felt he had little choice but to return to a part that clearly caused him much anguish.</p><p>At 45 and craving more serious work, the prospect of yet again trudging around the country in tights and cape, as children threw stones at him and teenagers challenged him to fights, may have become too much bare.</p><p>Was the coroner's verdict right after all? Had Reeves, drunk, unhappy and smarting at another argument with his new girlfriend Leonore Lemmon, pulled the trigger on his Luger whilst plumbing some dark trough of self pity?</p><p>Reeves was extremely intoxicated when he died, and also pumped full of painkillers to treat the injuries he received in his recent car accident. Alcohol, narcotics and depression are a red light warning sign for suicide, and with little other evidence available to them to suggest otherwise, it’s not hard to see why the Police came to this conclusion.</p><h3>A Dangerous Game</h3><p>One variation on this theory is that Reeves accidentally shot himself playing a game of Russian Roulette. Perhaps the toxic mixture of alcohol and painkillers had led to a fatal misjudgment?</p><p>Whilst it’s true the actor had a habit of playing dangerous games with his gun, naked in bed at 1am does not seem a very likely time for macabre party tricks. Besides, the gun was not a revolver and it was quite evident whether it was chambered or not.</p><p>If it was Reeves that pulled the trigger then in all likelihood it was because he had had enough of his life, for whatever reason. For decades friends, family and strangers alike have speculated on his mental state and whether he was the type of person to commit suicide or not, but the truth is only George Reeves himself knew what was truly going on in his mind.</p><p>All too often it is those closest to someone who takes their own life who can least understand it. The suicidal can become very adept at hiding their inner turmoil from their loved ones. Conversely, not everyone who is depressed about their career takes their own life.</p><p>After all these years, what happened that night at 1579 Benedict Canyon remains obscure and controversial. Everyone involved is now dead, and little or no evidence from the crime scene remains.</p><p>It is sometimes easy to get caught up in the mystery of George Reeves’ demise, the different theories and suspects. But the strange death of Superman is not a parlour game. There was a real man behind the superhero, whose tragic early death will likely forever be a mystery.</p>","tile":"george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman","path":"george-reeves-murder-the-death-of-superman","date":"2019-11-03T22:51:40.891Z","formatteddate":"Nov 3, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"George Reeves","subheadline":"The Death <span>of Superman</span>","snippet":"Was the star of 50s TV show The Adventures of Superman murdered?","tags":["hollywood","film","movie","murder","suicide","crime","cover-up","los angeles","police","detective","gun","death","unsolved","mystery"],"title":"George Reeves - The Death of Superman","tileheadline":"The Death of Superman"},{"body":"<p>-guy-fawkes-plotters.png</p><p>Guy Fawkes got lucky the day he and his fellow conspirators were executed.

Following the principle of Cui Bono - ‘Who Benefits’, he certainly gained the most from the whole affair, using it as leverage to enact a series of ever more repressive measures against the country’s Catholic minority. The previously unpopular King James also saw a surge in his popularity after the failed attempt on his life.</p><p>Had Cecil, schooled in the art of statecraft by his notoriously devious father - Elizabeth the I’s chief advisor William Cecil and the legendary spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, actually set the whole plot up himself and ensured its discovery, as part of his propaganda war against Catholicism?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>An explosive letter</h3><p>Late on the evening of October 26th a mysterious man called at the residence of William Parker, who sat in the House of Lords as Lord Monteagle. Whilst Monteagle himself was a Catholic, he was loyal to the protestant government of King James. Nevertheless, it seems a fellow Catholic was attempting to give him warning that his life was in danger.</p><p>Monteagle immediately took the letter to Robert Cecil, a search was organised, Fawkes discovered and the rest is history. However, some historians believe the entire affair of the anonymous letter was a theatrical scam concocted by Cecil, possibly with the complicity of Monteagle.</p><p>Whilst Monteagle pledged allegiance to the King, he was a Catholic was had written about how he found James ‘odious’. Yet despite this, and Cecil’s vitriolic hatred of Catholics, Cecil was scrupulous after the plot in both protecting Monteagle and rewarding him handsomely with a generous pension. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/monteagle-letter.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The anonymous letter to Lord Monteagle which led to the plot’s discovery</div></figcaption></figure><p>Was Monteagle on of Robert Cecil’s many spies? Had he already informed the Lord of the plot against the King, and was the letter merely a convenient way of ‘discovering’ the plot just in time to reap the maximum propaganda benefits? </p><p>It’s clear in the aftermath that Cecil attempted to erase any suspicion that might have pointed to Monteagle, his name is removed from several documents at the trial of the plotters, and critical letters Monteagle had previously written about the King are expunged from evidence. Cecil even goes as far to instruct the prosecution at the trial to speak favourably of Monteagle, and counter any rumours that he had betrayed the plot to Cecil.</p><p>Robert Cecil’s father, Elizabeth I’s chief advisor Lord Burgley, always welcomed plots against the Queen, the discovery of which not only strengthen his position but were of great political value in his machinations against the Queen's enemies. By all accounts his son had followed suit, assiduously using plots, both real and imagined, for the maximum political advantage to the King.</p><p>There is some evidence that Cecil may have been in the know long before the anonymous letter to Monteagle. A servant of one of the other key conspirators, Robert Catesby, claimed on his deathbed to have seen him with Cecil before November the 5th. It has also been speculated it was Cecil who arranged for a vault beneath the House to become vacant, to allow plotters to rent it.</p><p>Real evidence is, however scant. Perhaps the most tantalising suggestion of Cecil’s complicity in the plot comes from his own words. A few weeks before the Guy Fawkes was discovered, Cecil wrote to the King - “I spend my time in sowing so much seed as my poor wretched fingers can scatter, in such a season as may bring forth a plentiful harvest. I dare boldly say no shower or storm shall mar our harvest except it should come from beyond the middle region”. </p><p>The Midlands was were the majority of the plotters came from. It’s a perhaps deliberately vague statement from Cecil, but certainly seems to suggest he had some idea of the momentous events that would soon unfold.</p><h3>Gunpowder, treason and plot</h3><p>One issue often brought up by sceptics of the official story is the amount of gunpowder the conspirators had obtained. In 1601 gunpowder was made a government monopoly and became tightly regulated by the authorities, only to stored at secure government locations such as the Tower of London.</p><p>Somehow Fawkes and the other plotters had obtained a staggering 36 barrels of gunpowder, around 10,000 pounds worth. Although there was a glut of gunpowder at this time and it was obtainable on the black market, this is still a remarkable amount accounting for around a quarter of the entire stock of British gunpowder at the time.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/palace-of-westminister-1605.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The old Houses of Parliament before it burnt down in 1834</div></figcaption></figure><p>That the fiendish Robert Cecil, with spies throughout London, would be unaware that the men had been stockpiling such huge sums of gunpowder, and had been transporting it across the Thames to a cellar under the House of Lords in broad daylight, seems highly improbable. Was Cecil, as many historians believe, allowing the plot to ‘mature’ so he could thwart it just before it reached its conclusion?</p><p>The fortuitous way that the plotters ended up with a stash of 36 barrels of gunpowder in this cellar is also worthy of note. Anticipating that Parliament would open in February 1605, the men attempted to dig a tunnel under the House, but were thwarted by it continually flooding from the Thames above them. </p><p>However this did not put an end to the plan, as their setback coincided with a delay in the opening of that years parliament from February to October. During this intervening time, a cellar directly under the House also became available to rent and the extra time allowed the men to stockpile enough gunpowder there to blow Parliament sky high. </p><p>The way the pieces conveniently fell for the 13 men has led many to speculate that Robert Cecil was pulling the strings from the shadows. It also seems the government were already well prepared to capture the men after the plots discovery.</p><p>When Fawkes was discovered on the 5th, several of his compatriots retreated back to Holbech House in the Midlands, some 130 miles northwest of London. On November 7th and 8th most of the men were killed or captured in an armed standoff with the Sheriff of Worcestershire and a posse of 200 men. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/guido-fawkes-signature.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Fawkes’ signature before and after his torture</div></figcaption></figure><p>What is so suspicious about this is it came just hours after Fawkes’ confession under heavy torture on November the 7th. In an era before fast transport and instant communications, the speed of their capture was truly impressive and perhaps indicative that the authorities had prior knowledge of the plotters identities.</p><h3>The Ashes of a Conspiracy</h3><p>Much of the evidence that might shed light on the true facts about what happened on November the 5th 1605 is missing, fabricated or of dubious provenance. </p><p>With many of the plotters killed in the siege at Holbech House, and the others subjected to vicious torture, very little of the plotters own testimony survives, and what does is of questionable value in establishing the facts.</p><p>Fawkes own confession famously contains a barely legible signature, after he had endured hours of torture. If this confession is genuine and not concocted by Cecil himself, something he was known to do, it still remains unknown whether Fawkes told the truth as he knew it or just what his torturers wanted to hear. </p><p>Another conspirator named Thomas Wintour confessed to having been involving in the digging of the tunnel under the House, but no physical evidence of any tunnel was ever found in subsequent excavations in the 19th century, and it’s possible this detail at least was a government fabrication.</p><p>Cecil’s chief prosecutor of the conspiracy was the formidable Sir Edward Coke, one of the great legal minds of his age. Coke was certainly not adverse to fabricating evidence to help a case along, and was even known to hire forgers to alter confessions.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/execution-of-guy-fawkes.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">‘The execution of Guy Fawkes’ by Nicolaes Jansz Visscher</div></figcaption></figure><p>It’s clear in the case of Fawkes and Wintour that their confessions have been at least tampered with - edits, notes and alterations made by Coke and Cecil are clearly visible in some of the surviving copies. </p><p>Clearly the words of men obtained through torture, and possibly altered afterwards by their torturers, is not a good factual basis to understand what really happened on the first Bonfire Night. But it was the story the government wanted to hear, the one that was most politically useful to them and the one that remains in the history books today.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>I’m just a patsy</h3><p>All of the men involved in the gunpowder plot knew full well that treason would be met with the ultimate punishment Jacobean England had to offer. If caught, they would endure both torture and then an horrific execution. </p><p>They would be hung only to be cut down before death. In their weakened state they would be castrated, slit open across the abdomen and their intestines and organs pulled out and burnt beside their body. </p><p>It seems unlikely anyone other than a true believer, prepared to die a Catholic martyr, would risk such an agonising death. The simple fact that all thirteen of the conspirators were indeed killed or executed in the year following Fawkes discovery suggests that none of them were acting as government infiltrators within the plot.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/king-james-1605.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Catholics faced continued persecution under King James</div></figcaption></figure><p>There is no extant evidence than any of the men ever claimed they had been set up or that the government had had any knowledge or involvement in their plot. Facing certain death anyway they would have had nothing to lose in doing so if it was true.</p><p>It’s certainly possible it was one of the conspirators who was responsible for sending Lord Monteagle the warning letter, but this suggests naivety and poor judgement more than complicity.</p><h3>Too close to call</h3><p>If none of the men themselves were acting as government spies, is it possible that Robert Cecil had learnt of their plot quite early in its fermentation and decided to allow it to unravel so he could step in and foil before it reached its conclusion?</p><p>This sounds credible if not for how late in the day Guy Fawkes was rumbled. To allow the men to stockpile 36 barrels of gunpowder beneath Parliament and to be just hours away from blowing up the King and the entire British establishment would have been extraordinarily reckless.</p><p>Indeed despite the political mileage they were able to extract from it, it was a major embarrassment to the King and his advisors that they had come so close to been destroyed by one giant Catholic fireball, exposing to all how soft and vulnerable the underbelly of the British Crown actually was.</p><p>If Robert Cecil had really manipulated the plot for his own ends, it would have made more sense for it to have been discovered earlier, late enough in its advancement that it could be portrayed as a genuine threat but not so late that it made the King and his administration look so weak.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy/v-for-vendetta-anonymous.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The image of Guy Fawkes has been reclaimed by a new generation in their fight against government tyranny.</div></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately it was probably happenstance that the gunpowder plot turned out to be so advantageous to those it was meant to destroy. As for Guy Fawkes, the man who is cursed to burn atop thousands of bonfires around Britain every year on November the 5th, perhaps history has been unkind to him.</p><p>He was by all accounts a devout and earnest man who was fighting a repressive and deeply tyrannical government engaged in what amounted to ethnic cleansing. Many Catholics like Fawkes felt they had no choice but to attempt something so foolhardy with their very existence under threat.</p><p>In recent years the image of Guy Fawkes has been somewhat reclaimed from the flames by anti-capitalist anarchist groups like Anonymous. Inspired by the use of a Fawkes mask by the character of V in Alan Moores graphic novel ‘V for Vendetta’, thousands of people now wear it during demonstrations around the world against government tyranny.</p><p>If Guy did die the victim of the machinations of a sinister and repressive government, he is perhaps now, hundreds of years later, gaining some small portion of revenge.</p>","tile":"gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy","path":"gunpowder-plot-guy-fawkes-the-fall-guy","date":"2018-02-22T21:43:52.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 22, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Gunpowder Plot","subheadline":"The Fall <span>Guy</span>","snippet":"Was Guy Fawkes a patsy in a state-sponsored false flag conspiracy designed to persecute Catholics?","tags":["conspiracy","history","terrorism","Britain","1605","gunpowder","plot","Guido Fawkes","Guy Fawkes","fireworks","bonfires","guy","effigy","parliament","catholic","protestant","royal","king"],"title":"Gunpowder Plot - The Fall Guy","tileheadline":"The Fall Guy"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/charles-manson-mugshot.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Police mugshot of Charles Manson from 1969</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Dream is over.</p><p>Those words, written by John Lennon in his iconic 1970 song 'God' are often credited with ending the 1960s.

Although seven people in all were killed, the press and public focused on the death of the heavily pregnant Sharon Tate, an up and coming film actress who had recently married famous Polish film director Roman Polanski.</p><p>The first murders occurred in the early hours of August 9th at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, an upscale area of Los Angeles popular with musicians and actors. Even by the violent standards of the era, the killings were shocking.</p><p>Sharon Tate, men's hair stylist Jay Sebring, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, her boyfriend Wojciech Frykowski and student Steve Parent had all been slaughtered, their bloodied and beaten bodies scattered around the house and gardens. Those responsible for the carnage had written the word 'Pig' in blood on the property's front door.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/sharon-tate-wedding-By-RGoodellSr.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sharon Tate on her wedding day (credit R GoodellSr)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The following night, 10 miles away in a suburban area of Los Feliz, two more people were butchered. Supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary, a dress shop co-owner, were bound and brutally stabbed to death by home invaders. The killers left behind the words \"Rise\", \"Death to pigs\" and \"Healter Skelter\" in their victim's blood.</p><p>Police initially believed the murders at Cielo drive were the result of a drug transaction that had gone wrong - “Narcotics aspects are under investigation,” one officer was quoted as saying in the press. Suggestions that the killings were linked to the similar Labianca murders the following night, despite both crime scenes featuring inflammatory messages written in the victim's blood, were dismissed.</p><p>The narcotics angle seemed logical considering the huge spike in violent crime that accompanied the explosion of drug use during the 1960s. Just weeks earlier, music teacher Gary Hinman was murdered in a dispute over a drug deal. Involved in that crime were a group that would soon become centre-stage - Charles Manson and his followers, dubbed 'The Manson Family'.</p><p>Hinman was held hostage for three days by Manson member and budding musician Bobby Beausoleil for unpaid drug debts, during which Manson dropped by and cut part of Hinman's ear off with a cutlass. Beausoleil and another Manson follower named Susan Atkins eventually stabbed Hinman to death and wrote \"Political piggy\" on the walls in his blood.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/cielo-drive-door-pig.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">'Pig' was written in Sharon Tate's blood on the front door</div></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the obvious fact this crime was related in style to the recent carnage at Cielo Drive, police did not, either deliberately or due to a failure of intelligence, make any connection.</p><p>Meanwhile, amidst much sensational and lurid media coverage, wild rumours began to spread. These were heady and strange times in Hollywood, drug use and violence were rife and all manner of crackpots, cults, biker gangs, mobsters and even Satanists were connected by the press to the murders.</p><p>One group not suspected was an informal commune of hippies, dropouts, petty criminals and drug addicts who were ensconced at an old movie set in Death Valley called Spahn Ranch. Although a whole group of them were arrested shortly after the murders on suspicion of auto theft, they were subsequently let go without charge due to a legal problem with the arrest warrants.</p><p>One of those arrested and released was Charles Manson, a lifetime hoodlum and budding musician who had been hovering around the periphery of the Hollywood music scene since he was released on parole the year before. Manson had befriended such luminaries as Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and Neil Young, both of whom felt the eccentric Manson had promise as a musician.</p><p>The police investigation into the Tate-Labianca murders had begun to go cold when, in November, they made a crucial breakthrough. Susan Atkins, in jail for the murder of Gary Hinman, began to admit to various prison cellmates of her and other Spahn Ranch residents responsibility for the Tate and Labianca killings.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/political-piggy-hinman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">'Political Piggy' was written on the wall at the Hinman crime scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwkeel, and Linda Kasabian were subsequently arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murders. But it was Manson himself, now in custody for the auto-theft charges he had previously evaded, who would soon become central to the case.</p><p>Susan Atkins was initially offered immunity to testify against Manson and the other accused murderers but was regarded as so crazy and unstable as to be a liability to the case. It would ultimately be Linda Kasabian, who says she assisted but did not directly participate in the murders, who would be offered immunity to testify against her cohorts.</p><p>After months of pretrial wranglings the trial started in earnest in July 1970. Whilst the Los Angeles district attorney's office had acknowledged that others had committed the actual murders, prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi wanted to portray Charles Manson as the mastermind of the killings.</p><p>Described by the melodramatic Bugliosi as 'the trial of the century', a vast media circus quickly surrounded proceedings, much of it centered around the strange figure of Charles Manson. From almost complete obscurity, the often bewildered Manson soon found himself elevated to the status of a national bogeyman, a place in the American psyche he has continued to occupy for nearly 50 years.</p><p>Demonised in the press, Manson was portrayed as the nightmare of every middle-class parent. A kind of sinister pied piper figure brainwashing otherwise good kids into brutal acts of violence. In an extraordinary move, President Nixon would come out and publicly declare him guilty before the trial had even properly begun.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/cielo-drive.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Roman Polanski's house at Cielo Drive was at the centre of the carnage</div></figcaption></figure><p>Defensive lawyers filed for a mistrial but were denied, as were their efforts to have the trial moved to a less prejudicial setting. The judge ruled that the publicity and media attention surrounding Manson was so huge that it would be hard to find an impartial jury anywhere in the country.</p><p>He looked doomed before the prosecution even set out their case. On the flimsiest of evidence, Manson would be portrayed as an evil cult leader who used his magnetic personality to hypnotise his followers into doing his devilish work. This scenario struck a chord with the jury and the public and has since become the widely accepted truth of the matter.</p><p>Bugliosi and his team still had a problem, however. Manson may have exerted enough psychological control over his followers to persuade them to murder for him, but what was the motive? The LA District attorney's office was keen to overlook the amount of illegal drugs found at the house, and there had been no discernable robbery, so why had Manson ordered the brutal murder of seven people?</p><p>It was here one of the most extraordinary prosecution theories in criminal history was born. Chiefly dreamt up by Vincent Bugliosi, the case against Manson would centre on his contention that he was a homicidal racist who ordered his followers to commit mass-murder in order to start an apocalyptic race war in America.</p><p>Crucially, as we shall subsequently see, those that died were thus portrayed as indiscriminate and unlucky victims, picked entirely at random to fulfill some crazed scheme of Manson's.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/cielo-drive-living-room.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The living room where the heavily pregnant Sharon Tate was slaughtered.</div></figcaption></figure><p>This plan, which Manson supposedly called 'Helter Skelter' was inspired by a bizarre mishmash of the New Testament Book of Revelation and lyrics from the Beatles’ 1968 double album 'The Beatles', which Manson twisted to become a message to rise up before the black man gained the upper hand.</p><p>After starting the race-war, Manson and his followers would eventually emerge in the aftermath as rulers of the world, with the remaining black population as their slaves. As outlandish as this may sound, the jury bought Bugliosi's theory and Manson and the murderers were all found guilty and subsequently sentenced to death.</p><p>These sentences were later commuted to life after California abolished the death penalty in 1972, and all of those convicted remain in prison to this day, unlikely ever to be released despite the periodic ritual of futile parole hearings.</p><p>In 1974, Bugliosi wrote a book about the trial titled 'Helter Skelter', which further reinforced this extraordinary scenario in the public mind. It went on to become the biggest selling true-crime book of all time.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/linda-kasabian-mugshot.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Bugliosi's theory relied heavily on the testimony of Linda Kasabian, who was offered immunity</div></figcaption></figure><p>But how much truth was there in Helter Skelter? Even some of Bugliosi's colleagues, like fellow prosecutor Aaron Stovitz, were skeptical about the bizarre theory.</p><p>Could the far less sensational explanation be that these were simply violent drug murders of the type that had become sadly all too common in the area? And was Manson a convenient scapegoat?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Helter Skelter</h3><p>During the trial, Charles Manson was given a psychological evaluation by state psychologists and found to be entirely sane and rational. It was also discovered he had a higher than normal IQ and a sound grasp of legal procedure, enough that he was deemed capable of representing himself.</p><p>Yet according to Bugliosi's prosecution theory, this street-wise and wily ex-con devised a plan - Helter Skelter, that is mainly noted for its staggering inanity. Both the plan and, unfortunate pun aside, its execution were so absurd as to be laughable.</p><p>But Bugliosi's intense zeal to pursue Manson and to push his Helter Skelter theory seemed to override the widespread skepticism and objections of other prosecutors, the police, the judge, investigators and multiple other commentators on the case, all of whom expressed their doubt about a notion even Bugliosi would occasionally describe as ridiculous.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/manson-trial.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Manson would often play up for the cameras at the trial</div></figcaption></figure><p>Bugliosi's Helter Skelter theory contended that Manson, inspired by his twisted reading of lyrics on the Beatles's White Album, came to believe a race war - 'Helter Skelter' was imminent. Supposedly spurred on by his vicious racism he wanted to precipitate the war between white and blacks so he could emerge afterward as the leader of the remaining black population.</p><p>Already, this seems too strange to actually be the plan of someone who was not seriously mentally disturbed, which Manson certainly wasn't. But how they were to provoke Helter Skelter is even more unbelievable.</p><p>According to Bugliosi, Manson would order his followers, who were under his hypnotic spell, to go out and murder some rich white people in such a way as it would be blamed on the black population. To this end, he sent Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Patricia Krenwinkel out into Beverly Hills to enact his evil plot.</p><p>In the early hours of August 9th, they happened upon Sharon Tate's house, slaughtered everyone inside and then wrote the word 'pig' on the door in Tate's blood. This masterstroke would make it appear the crimes had been committed by blacks, thus starting Manson's race war.</p><p>An obvious problem with this plan is the word pig was not used exclusively by, or associated with, the black population. In actual fact it was old English slang for police, adopted predominantly by the white middle-class anti-establishment movement of the 1960s. The idea the police would infer the use of the word meant the perpetrators were black is an enormous stretch of imagination.</p><p>Since everyone involved with the murders that night were white and middle class, it's fairly obviously they would have known this. Perhaps Manson himself realized how weak his plan was, as according to Bugliosi the next night he ordered more murders, again with the intention to make it appear they had been committed by blacks.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/healter-skelter-fridge-labianca.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A misspelled reference to the Beatles song was written on the Labianca's fridge</div></figcaption></figure><p>On August 10th, Tex Watson, Linda Kasabian, Susan Atkins, Steve Grogan and Leslie Van Houten again took to the streets of Los Angeles looking for more victims. Although joined initially by Manson, he would leave before anybody was killed. Happening at the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca at 3301 Waverly Drive, a similar tale of bloody murder unfolded inside and more inflammatory slogans were written in blood on the walls.</p><p>According to Linda Kasabian the idea this time was to take LaBianca's wallet and leave it in a black area of town. Manson's diabolical intention was that a black man would find the wallet, use the credit cards and subsequently be blamed for the murders.</p><p>To this end, Kasabian hid the wallet inside a cistern at a gas station hotel, in a predominately white area of town, where it wouldn't be found for another 4 months. Evidently, leaving a wallet in a cistern is not a serious attempt to start a race-war, so whatever the gang were up to that night it appeared to bear little relation to the notion of Helter Skelter.</p><p>In practice, Bugliosi's explanation for the actions of the murderers over the two nights make no sense and look for all the world like a far-fetched prosecutorial concoction created after the fact, designed to implicate somebody who was not even present - Charles Manson, in the killings.</p><p>Much of his evidence comes from Linda Kasabian, more directly involved in the murders themselves than Manson but offered immunity to testify against him. It was in her self-interest to tell Bugliosi what he wanted to hear however absurd it sounded outside of the courtroom.</p><p>When Tex Watson, the ring leader on both nights of carnage and the man who actually committed the murders, heard about the Helter Skelter plot been pushed by the prosecution and Manson's alleged hypnotic powers, he was heard to say - \"Charlie! Fuck man, no way!\".</p><p>Watson's involvement was almost the most absurd part of Bugliosi's entire case. Whereas it's not too hard to see how the charismatic older  Manson might be able to persuade impressionable young girls to do his bidding, the idea that Tex Watson - a tall, good-looking and well-educated alpha male type could be so comprehensively manipulated seems particularly unlikely.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/text-watson-mugshot.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Tex Watson's mugshot</div></figcaption></figure><p>Watson was never part of the inside circle around Manson and actually spent little time at the Spahn ranch, preferring to hang out in LA and develop his drug dealing career. Whilst superficially charming and charismatic, Watson was a violent psychopath and not the kind of man to be pushed around by anyone, least of all the much shorter Manson.</p><p>He also had form, having ripped off black drug dealer Bernard Crowe a few months earlier, and tied up and robbed Mafia-connected drug dealer Joel Roseau and his girlfriend the previous month. Watson's behaviour indicated he was following his own criminal path, rather than Manson's hypnotic will, and probably regarded the wily old-con more as useful ally than master.</p><p>So his initial incredulity at being informed he was actually under Manson's evil, cult-like spell was well placed. In reality, a far more convincing reason for Watson and the other members of the so-called 'family' to blame it all on Manson was to try and save their own skin.</p><blockquote><span>\"I was convicted of witchcraft in the Twentieth Century\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>If Watson could make it look like he had been brainwashed into committing the murders and he was otherwise a good Christian boy, then he might just escape the inevitable death sentence coming to someone who had brutally murdered seven people in cold blood.</p><p>Clearly the testimony of these murders was self-serving and unreliable as genuine evidence, either against Manson or regarding any aspect of the case. But it is not a prosecutor's job to find the truth, only to persuade a jury, and Bugliosi's courtroom flair managed to do exactly that.</p><p>He was helped in no small part by the prejudiced media reporting  surrounding the trial that gave Manson little or no chance of a fair hearing. Furthermore, as his position looked increasingly doomed, Manson  himself seemed determined to give the public what they wanted, playing up to the fantasy of the evil cult leader in a series of increasingly eccentric courtroom appearances.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/helter-skelter-book-bugliosi.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Helter Skelter is the best selling true crime book of all time</div></figcaption></figure><p>But the craziness was a showman's act, Manson was perfectly aware he was been railroaded by the ambitious prosecutor - \"I was convicted of witchcraft in the Twentieth Century and my case made the prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, filthy rich behind the book and the film he wrote.\"</p><p>Indeed, Bugliosi became world famous off the back of the case, and would frequently refer to the fact he was the man who 'prosecuted Charles Manson' when promoting his books or political ambitions.</p><p>Despite building an entire career off the back of the Manson trial, Bugliosi's achievement boiled down to convincing 12 people that Manson had sufficient quasi-mystical abilities to convince others to commit brutal murder for him. In other words, witchcraft in the 20th century.</p><h3>The Drugs Connection</h3><p>For many, the way the police initially concentrated on the \"narcotic aspects\" of the case has always pointed towards a more credible  explanation for the murders than Helter Skelter.</p><p>Drugs are everywhere in the story, a fact which Vincent Bugliosi and the Los Angeles district attorney's office were scrupulous in trying to downplay at the trial.</p><p>Many theorists, including author Nikolas Schreck in his mammoth tome on the case 'The Manson File' believe the Cielo drive murders were a drug burn, Tex Watson's thuggish attempt to muscle in on a big drug deal occurring at the property that turned into a brutal murder spree.</p><p>There are good reasons to suspect that the Tate murders were drug related. The drug burn murder of Gary Hinman by several of the Spahn ranch regulars was clearly related to the Tate-Labianca killings, not only because of the overlap in the perpetrators, but also the distinctive common factor of political messages scrawled on the walls in the victim's blood.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/nikolas-schreck.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Nikolas Schreck's book advocates the drug burn theory</div></figcaption></figure><p>The failure of prosecutors to link the crimes could charitably be described as incompetence, but seems far more likely to be a deliberate oversight in order to ensure the drug angle in the high profile Tate murders was not pursued.</p><p>The purpose of this is not hard to discern, and one does not have to propose any kind of orchestrated conspiracy. Simply that the establishment in LA instinctively wanted to prevent the dark underbelly of its most important export - Hollywood itself, been exposed to the world.</p><p>Because underneath the glitter of Tinseltown lay an open secret, since its early days the fantasies of Hollywood have been built on the seedy foundation of illegal drugs and mob money, with all the brutal violence that inevitably follows.</p><p>According to Schreck's research in the Manson file, what transpired at Cielo drive in the early hours of August 9th 1969 was the bloody consequences of a turf war between ambitious small-time drug dealer Tex Watson and established suppliers Wojciech Frykowski and Jay Sebring over the lucrative Hollywood drug scene.</p><p>Sebring and Frykowski have both been named by several authors over the years as suppliers of narcotics to actors and musicians in Hollywood. A loose-knit network of stars that included such names as Mama Cass and Steve McQueen, as well as Polanski and Tate, whose house at Cielo Drive appeared to be a base for some of the dealing.</p><p>Peripherally involved in this network were Manson and his followers. In his autobiography, Michael Caine recalls meeting Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring at a party held by Mama Cass. Caine also recalls how Charles Manson and 'some girls' were also at the party, indicating the obvious possibility that Manson and his followers were already known to Sebring and Tate.</p><p>Both the FBI and the LA Police had evidence for drug dealing at Polanski's property. An FBI report dated 19 August refers to the possibility and police reports after the murders suggest a variety of different drugs were found in Jay Sebring's black Porsche parked near the house.</p><p>The police's second homicide report into the Tate murders also quotes Sebring receptionist Karlene Anne McCaffrey about how Mafia drug dealer Joel Rostau had visited the property on the night of the murders to deal drugs with Sebring and Frykowski.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/wojciech-frykowski-pregnant-sharon-tate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jay Sebring took this photograph of Wojciech Frykowski and a heavily pregnant Sharon Tate just days before their deaths</div></figcaption></figure><p>\"Rostau informed McCaffrey that he had delivered cocaine and mescaline to the house but that Frykowski and Sebring wanted some additional narcotics and that he had gone back down the hill but was unable to locate the other narcotics they requested and therefore he did not return to the Tate residence.\"</p><p>The report continues - \"McCaffrey stated that on August 7, 1969, she had talked to Sebring and he had informed her that he had been burnt on $2,000 worth of bad cocaine. McCaffrey stated that in her opinion Sebring would do almost anything to get back at the person who had burnt him.\"</p><p>In his book Family, author Ed Sanders details Sebring's violent reprisal against the supplier of the cocaine. \"A large party was held on Cielo Drive at which Billy Doyle...was whipped as the result of a dope burn involving about $2K worth of cocaine which was perpetrated on Jay Sebring, who was present at the affair\".</p><p>This incident makes it clear the dealings at Cielo drive had already begun to spiral into violence. With Tex Watson also operating in the same area, had a dispute over territory or a bad deal lead to the murders?</p><p>Although important to be suspicious of all the testimony of the Manson group after the murders, some of it does point to a drug burn. At the penalty phase of the trial, Susan Atkins would state that Linda Kasabian \"told me to get a knife and a change of clothes…she said these people in Beverly Hills had burned her for $1,000 for some new drug, MDA.\"</p><p>That the murders were the result of a drug dispute is clearly a credible scenario when placed in the context of the previous violent behavior of those involved, the Beausoleil murder and the amount of drugs that crop up repeatedly in the story. But how do the events of the next night fit into the theory?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/death-to-pigs.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Death to Pigs was written on the Labianca's wall in Leno's blood</div></figcaption></figure><p>The set of murders at the Labianca household on August 10th are also connected to this drug war by Schreck, although the links are weaker. It does seem a fair possibility Tex Watson, Jay Sebring and Rosemary Labianca may have previously known each other as they were all involved in the LA wig trade.</p><p>More importantly, Joe Dorgan, the man who found Leno and Rosemary's bodies, was the boyfriend of Rosemary's daughter. Dorgan was a member of the Straight Satans, the biker gang that frequented the Spahn ranch and had many dealings with both Manson and Watson.</p><p>The Satans were the supposed reason Manson follower Bobby Beausoleil ending up killing Gary Hinman, as a batch of bad drugs he had obtained from Hinman had made several Satans members sick.</p><p>The Manson File also implicates Rosemary Labianca herself in this nexus of drug dealing, using her wig shop as a front. Labianca was far wealthier than her and her husband's straight business dealings would justify, leading to persistent rumors she was involved in drug dealing.</p><p>This claim would be a crucial connecting factor in the whole theory if true. It would increase the likelihood that Rosemary had had some dealings, and possible clashes, with Tex Watson and the other Manson family members prior to the murders.</p><p>These links would contradict the whole premise of Bugliosi's Helter Skelter scenario - that the killings were random acts of violence purely committed to incite a race war.</p><p>Instead, could it be that the Labiancas, like the residents of Cielo drive, were actually killed as part of a struggle for dominance in the low-level drug underworld of late 60s LA? And was the fantastical Helter Skelter narrative merely a Hollywood-style fantasy to hide the dark reality of what was really going on in Tinsel Town?</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Motives</h3><p>One of the most prominent proponents of the drug burn theory is author Nikolas Schreck, whose book The Manson File is a major work on the case. Schreck, who got to know Charles Manson very well during the writing of the book, compiled his work from years of research on the ground in LA and dozens of interviews with direct participants in the case.</p><p>However, some of his evidence and conclusions have been questioned by other authors. Schreck relies heavily on unnamed witnesses - the author says they would only talk on condition of anonymity. Clearly, that makes validation of his claims difficult.</p><p>In particularly his claim that Rosemary Labianca dealt drugs, which provides a significant link between her and the murderers, stems solely from Schreck's anonymous sources. Other authors have also suggested Labianca was dealing, but the suggestion remains nothing more than a rumor with little hard evidence to back it up.</p><p>Despite many lurid details about the Labianca's activities and proclivities appearing in police reports, it's never mentioned anywhere that they made money from illegal narcotics.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/leno-rosamary-labianca.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Leno and Rosamary Labianca</div></figcaption></figure><p>The thinness of this part of the theory is troubling. If Rosemary Labianca didn't deal drugs, then there would be little motive for Tex Watson to eliminate her from his turf.</p><p>This is a potentially killer blow to the whole drug burn theory. If there was no drugs motive in the Labianca murder, then it would strongly suggest there wasn't in the Tate murders at Cielo drive either. The two crimes are so intimately connected in both style and personnel that it seems unlikely there was not a common purpose behind them.</p><p>However, it's possible a combination of motives were at play. As described earlier, Tex Watson never seemed the kind of man to be a follower. It could be that the more calculating Watson gatecrashed some vague notion of Helter Skelter Manson was spouting out at Spahn ranch in order to further his own agenda to assert control over small-scale drug dealing in the area.</p><p>But the Labianca murders remain difficult to explain as part of that narrative. If Watson was serious about taking control of the drugs trade in the area, would he really involve himself in a completely unrelated home invasion and slaughter the night after eliminating his main rivals?</p><h3>Testimony</h3><p>Members of the Manson family have all given statements that support Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter theory of the murders. Whilst not exactly consistent, or even particularly reliable or trustworthy, Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and the others involved in the murders have generally tended towards the official prosecution story.</p><p>Watson has repeatedly stated how Manson gathered the group together on the day of the murders and instructed him that \"Now is the time for Helter Skelter\". The others have given similar accounts.</p><p>At the trial Linda Kasabian, whilst granted immunity for her statements, gave a detailed account consistent with Tex Watson's. \"We got about to the middle of the driveway, you know, and Charlie called us and told us to stop, and he came to the car to my side of the window, stuck his head in, and told us to leave a sign. He said, 'You girls know what I mean, something witchy,' and that was it.\"</p><blockquote><span>\"Now is the time for Helter Skelter\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Little or nothing said by the main players over the years really support the drug burn motive. Watson especially, the central figure in the drugs theory, has always disavowed it. Even now, secure in the knowledge he will never be released, he has not admitted to anything beyond the official narrative.</p><p>It would obviously be foolish to take anything said by these murderers at face value. For all those directly involved in the killings, it was in their self-interest to go along with the prosecution case. Attempting to absolve themselves of some of the blame by endorsing the Manson Helter Skelter motive was their slimmest hope of ever getting parole.</p><p>The only figure who has never wavered in rejecting Helter Skelter is Manson himself. Whatever garbage he has spouted over the years, he's always been relatively clear, by his standards, that Bugliosi's prosecution case bore no relation to anything he was involved in.</p><h3>Other theories</h3><p>Events as bloody and infamous as the Tate-Labianca murders and the incredible show trial of Manson were always going to attract alternative explanations.</p><p>Everything from devil worshipping rituals to a staged psyop have been suggested over the years.  However, a more mundane interpretation of events is that the murders were simply the chaotic consequences of damaged, drug-addled petty criminals running out of control.</p><p>If one description best sums up Charles Manson, it's not cult-leader, but petty-criminal. He had spent most of his life in prison because of small-scale offenses - stealing cars, burglaries, fraud. In actual fact the reason Manson was first arrested after the murders was because he and his gang at Spahn ranch had been stealing cars.</p><p>The regulars at Spahn ranch were a ragtag group of dropouts, thieves, bikers and hippies, their common connection been they spent most of their time strung out on drugs and looking for their next criminal enterprise. Some of them may have bought into Manson's bizarre ramblings or simply hung out with him because he was an experienced criminal who was capable of smoothing things over when they got into trouble.</p><p>Either way, Manson and his associates at Spahn ranch were responsible for the murder of Gary Hinman, but even that looks more like a bungled extortion than premeditated murder. Despite the fatal ending, it worked and they got hold of Hinman's car - a mundane reason for a man's death but an example of the small-time level of Manson's thinking.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/helter-skelter-coming-down-fast/blood-stains-outside-cielo-drive.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Blood stains found outside the Cielo drive crime scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>Manson's criminal mind may have come to see that sending in a bunch of crazy looking hippies waving knives might be a good way to scare his debtors into paying up.</p><p>Is this a credible explanation for what happened at Cielo Drive? There is reason to believe that Manson felt a former resident of the property - Doris Day's son and record producer Terry Melcher, owed him money or at least held a grudge against him for reneging on a record deal he believed he was promised.</p><p>Could Manson, thinking Melcher still lived at the house, have sent some of his followers in to try and scare him into paying up?</p><p>Bugliosi tried to downplay it during the trial, but at least 2 of the killers that night were already high on drugs when they entered the property. This combined with Tex Watson's undoubted psychopathy could have caused the party to freak out when confronted not by Melcher, but a house full of frightened strangers.</p><p>Whilst obviously speculation, it's not hard to see how such a scenario might have quickly escalated from a violent fight into murder. But is this really sufficient to account for the sheer level of brutality evident in the crime scene? That might seem a stretch, but is it any more of a stretch than the same perpetrators committing the same crime because of some crazy notion of Helter Skelter?</p><p>Susan Atkins, who was present at the Hinman crime scene where 'political piggy' was written on the wall in blood, may also have even written 'pig' at Cielo drive as part of some warped and kooky attempt to make it look like Bobby Beausoleil was innocent of the Hinman murder.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Amidst this miasma, only three things are really certain. The first is we'll never get any sense out of Charles Manson himself. Only he truly knows whether Helter Skelter was real but his bizarre mindset, impenetrable patois and ever changing stories make him a bewildering figure to try and understand.</p><p>Secondly, this makes him a terrific scapegoat, one that continues to fascinate and appall in equal measure nearly 50 years on.</p><p>Thirdly, whether dreamt up by a crazed cult leader or an ambitious prosecutor, Helter Skelter remains one of the strangest and most troubling chapters in the whole of 20th century crime.</p>","tile":"helter-skelter-coming-down-fast","path":"helter-skelter-coming-down-fast","date":"2018-02-21T21:19:34.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 21, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Helter Skelter","subheadline":"Coming <span>Down Fast</span>","snippet":"Were the Tate-LaBianca murders attributed to Charles Manson actually the results of a drug burn?","tags":["Charles Manson","Manson","Manson Family","Sharon Tate","LaBianca","Tate-LaBianca","Tex Watson","Roman Polanski","1960s","1969","Los Angeles","police","Bugliosi","Beatles","Helter Skelter","unsolved","murder","Hollywood","drugs","Mafia","underworld","celebrity"],"title":"Helter Skelter - Coming Down Fast","tileheadline":"Coming Down Fast"},{"body":"<p>Jack the Ripper represents perhaps the most perplexing mystery in the history of crime.</p><p>A Victorian serial killer who killed five prostitutes in the Whitechapel area of London in 1888, the Ripper’s identity is as elusive today as it was that bloodsoaked Autumn long ago.</p><p>Hundreds of books, films and documentaries have speculated on the killer’s true identity, offering countless theories.</p><p>Of all these theories, arguably the most influential and famous was first posited by author Stephen Knight in the 1970s.

Kubrick's work has exerted both an immense influence on other filmmakers and considerable impact on our wider popular culture.</p><p>But as time went on, the gaps between each film grew longer, as the meticulous Kubrick begun to obsess over ever detail of his work. Each film became the culmination of years of preparation, the ostensible story and plots becoming secondary to Kubrick's more esoteric concerns. Perhaps more than any other filmmaker, Kubrick's work is analysed for its hidden meanings.</p><p>The director's classic 1968 science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey often appears on film critics all time best lists. It's exploration of mankind's evolution been guided by an alien force revolutionised film special effects. But it was more than just a technical feat, it was a work of art exploring metaphysical concepts using visual metaphors and symbolism.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/kubrick-1949.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kubrick as a young photographer in 1949</div></figcaption></figure><p>Of all Kubrick's film, the one that has captured the public imagination more than any other appears to be his simplest. At its release in 1980, many wondered why the great filmmaker had chosen to adapt a straightforward horror novel by Stephen King. The film puzzled critics and King himself hated it for making inexplicable changes to his source material.</p><p>That film was the Shining. It is the story of a writer named Jack Torrence, played by Jack Nicholson, who goes mad whilst acting as the winter caretaker at an isolated hotel. Early in the film it is revealed that the previous caretaker also went mad and hacked to death his wife and children. Torrence's young son, blessed with a supernatural power named the Shining, then starts to experience visions of this traumatic event.</p><p>Torrence becomes increasingly unhinged by strange supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel and begins to experience his own troubling visions. Eventually, he loses his sanity entirely and attempts to follow in his predecessor's footsteps and murder his wife and children with an axe.</p><p>For anyone who has read the book, It's easy to see why it's author was unhappy with the resulting film. It only really plays lip service to the basic plot of the novel, and makes many often minor plot changes for no obvious reason. Most of King's thematic concerns were also discarded, much to his annoyance. Kubrick appeared to be using the shell of the story to serve a more impenetrable and arcane purpose.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/2001-poster.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">2001 is recognised as one of the best sci-fi films ever made</div></figcaption></figure><p>As common with many of Kubrick's films, the Shining has undergone a critical reassessment in recent years. Often dismissed in 1980 as a curiously flat and unscary longueur, many critics now regard it as a uniquely unsettling masterpiece of the horror genre.</p><p>At the same time, a number of commentators have begun to explore the hidden meanings in the film. The Shining has since become one of the most analysed films of all time, its intricate subtexts attracting a variety of readings. Clearly beneath what remained of Stephen King's book, there was some other narrative, but what exactly was Kubrick trying to tell us?</p><p>In 2012, director Rodney Ascher found enough competing interpretations about the true meaning behind the Shining to justify a whole documentary film about them.  Room 237 examines five of the most popular theories, allowing their authors to describe them in their own words.</p><p>One of the contributors in the film thinks the Shining is really about the massacre of the native Americans, another that it is an extended metaphor about the holocaust. A segment in the film explores the theory that the Shining's hidden meanings are only revealed when it is played backwards and forwards simultaneously.</p><p>Room 237 is an entertaining documentary but the arguments set out by the various contributors are often absurd and nebulous. It's easy to read anything into something as ambiguous and dense as the Shining. It is like a mirror that reflects back at you whatever you project at it.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/room237-poster.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Room 237 explores the various theories about The Shining</div></figcaption></figure><p>The other problem with most of these theories is there would be no reason for Kubrick to hide them in a horror film about a haunted hotel. If he had wanted to explore the theme of the holocaust or the American Indians, both widely covered in American cinema, there would be no reason to be so cryptic about it.</p><p>Perhaps what Kubrick wanted to tell us was something darker and more personal. Something he would want, or need, to hide inside a film that seemed on the surface to be about something else. One contributor to Room 237 follows this reasoning with the most outlandish theory of all; the Shining is actually a hidden confession to Kubrick's involvement with faking the footage of the Apollo moon landings.</p><p>Filmmaker Jay Weidner has set out this idea before, in his own full-length documentary named Kubrick's Odyssey in 2011. It is based on a pre-existing conspiracy theory that Kubrick was approached by NASA during the production of 2001 in the mid-60s to help them fake the footage of the Apollo 11 mission as a failsafe in case the astronauts did not make it to the moon.</p><p>Weidner believes that Kubrick used the state of the art special effects he developed for 2001 to help NASA fake the footage of the first moon landing and, racked with guilt about the deception, decided to put a secret 'confession' about what he'd done in the Shining.</p><p>Weidner's idea has become an extremely popular and widely disseminated conspiracy theory on the internet, inspiring countless  youtube videos and websites. But it is really two separate theories, and Weidner's' connecting of them is highly speculative.</p><p>We clearly do not have to believe the footage of the Apollo landings were faked, or that Kubrick did the faking, to believe he put references to them in the Shining. There could have been a variety of other motives for doing so. The question is, are the references there at all or is it the overactive imagination of those confounded by Kubrick's byzantine filmmaking style?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/danny-apollo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Danny seems to be a visual metaphor for Apollo 11</div></figcaption></figure><p>That there is at least one reference to Apollo 11 in the Shining is beyond much dispute. It is not in the book and like several other important parts of the film, is an addition Kubrick himself made for reasons not entirely clear.</p><p>At the twenty minute mark, Jack Torrance's young son Danny is seen playing on the richly patterned carpet in one of the hotels corridors. Sensing something is drawing him to Room 237, he rises up to reveal he is wearing a jumper with an Apollo 11 rocket knitted into its front.</p><p>Stanley Kubrick is widely regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time and a master of visual metaphor. The analogy between Danny and the launch of the Saturn 5 rocket to the moon was undoubtedly deliberate, but to what effect? Some critics have attempted to fit this curious moment into the film's conventional narrative, but it doesn't seem to serve any obvious purpose in the story.</p><p>For proponents of the theory, this sequence was merely the most obvious of a whole string of Apollo references in the Shining, enough for them to be both deliberate and meaningful. This was Kubrick they argue, a man with a track record of using cryptic symbols in his films, from 2001 and a Clockwork Orange right up to his enigmatic final work Eyes Wide Shut. Nothing was put on the screen by chance.</p><p>Does the Shining contain a secret message about the Apollo moon landings? And if so, what was the purpose?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Again and Again and Again</h3><p>By the time Kubrick came to make The Shining in 1978-79, he already had a reputation as an exacting perfectionist. But the shoot of his version of Stephen's King's novel would become notorious for both the treatment of the actors and the vast overrun of its schedule</p><p>For what was ostensibly a relatively straightforward horror film, Kubrick spent a staggering 13 months on its production, most of it on the backlot of Elstree studios in England, the home of the vast Overlook hotel set in which most of the films action takes place.</p><p>For some reason it seemed particularly important to Kubrick to get this one absolutely right, and the film would become legendary in the movie business for the number of takes used for even the most mundane of scenes. The films lead actors, Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson, were often pushed close to breaking point by Kubrick's insistence on filming the same scenes dozens of times.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/shelly-duvall-shining.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Shelley Duvall was forced to film scenes hundreds of times</div></figcaption></figure><p>The director forced his actors to perform one famous moment in the film, the confrontation between an unhinged Jack and a baseball bat wielding Wendy an incredible 127 times, with both of them close to tears at the endless repetition of same lines, often for little or no obvious reason.</p><p>Duvall in particular suffered a great deal during the films production, Kubrick’s treatment of the then 29 year old American actress little short of bullying. Duvall suffered from nervous exhaustion throughout the shoot, and became so ill her hair would fall out.</p><p>Was Kubrick so unconcerned by the welfare of his actors, or was his obsessive refilming of the same scenes more about capturing important and perhaps fleeting details in the sets, the backgrounds, the props and the framing? Cinematographers have a term for this, mise-en-scène and Kubrick was a master of the art.</p><p>Part of this came from his background as photographer. He learnt early how to use framing, scenery and props as storytelling devices, but it was rarely spontaneous. Before each project he would undertake months, sometimes years of painstaking preparation, research and storyboarding before he filmed a single scene.</p><p>Kubrick’s planned, but ultimately unmade Napoleon film involved vast amounts of research, location scouting, photographs and storyboards, eventually amounting to hundreds of filing boxes worth of material.</p><p>All of the scenes in Eyes Wide Shut set on the streets of Greenwich village were filmed in meticulously recreated sets constructed on the backlot of Pinewood Studios, England, with every lamp post, sidewalk and newspaper vending machine exactly modelled on their real life New York equivalents.</p><p>On this last, most mysterious of Kubrick films, he went as far as personally overseeing the design and placement of every set set, prop, and costume, right down to the furniture and even the color of the walls.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/eyes-wide-shut.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kubrick’s enigmatic last film Eyes Wide Shut</div></figcaption></figure><p>With the degree of preparation and control Kubrick had over his work, it’s hard to imagine anything in his films was there by chance. A director like this doesn’t film something 100 or more times unless everything that he his is capturing in the frame of his camera has a purpose.</p><p>With most other filmmakers, the kind of strange allusions and references we see to the moon landings in The Shining could easily be dismissed as chance, or simply peripheral dressing that has no real meaning. Knowing what we do about Kubrick, it much harder to make this determination.</p><p>But before we take a closer look at The Shining itself, it may be worth a brief review of some of the acknowledged hidden meanings in some of Kubrick's other films by way of comparison.</p><h3>What Lies Beneath</h3><p>Few film critics who have studied Stanley Kubrick's work doubt they contain some abstruse subtexts, although exactly what they are remains more contentious. Fewer still can cite a more meticulous or exacting director or one who spent more time and attention on every shot.</p><p>Kubrick himself preferred to remain silent about his filmmaking process - \"In all things mysterious – never explain\", he told the press in an interview to promote The Shining. It is a quote from the great horror author H.P. Lovecraft, whose own work contained its fair share of  secrets.</p><p>Codes and symbols fascinated the director all his life. According to his personal assistant Anthony Frewin, Kubrick regarded 'The Codebreakers', David Kahn's 1967 book about secret writing and code breaking as one of the most important works of the 20th century.</p><p>The Codebreakers is a detailed history of message encryption and decryption and how they have been used by intelligence agencies, criminals and secret societies throughout the ages. Kubrick’s interest in it betrays a lifetime fascination with ciphers and the esoteric, an interest which can help inform our understanding of what is really going on in the filmmaker's work.</p><blockquote><span>\"I think clearly there’s a problem with people who are not paying attention with their eyes. They’re listening. And they don’t get much from listening to this film.\"</span><br><cite>Stanley Kubrick</cite></blockquote><p>As with the interpretation of any creative work, it is often a fine line between correctly finding meaning and having one's imaginative run away with itself. In 1964, shortly after the release of his film Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick made a rare acknowledgement that somebody had correctly found that line.</p><p>Responding to a fan's letter, the director congratulated them on finding some hidden sexual references in the film that seemed to have eluded the professional critics. Had they simply missed the obvious or were they afraid of looking silly for seeing things that were not there?</p><p>Perhaps of all the director's films, the most overtly vague and subjective is 2001. At its release in 1968 the film became a favourite of the counterculture generation, who would often attend multiple screenings whilst tripping on LSD. The film chimed with many at the time as a message to mankind about expanding human consciousness, although its many depths are still debated to this day.</p><p>As an essentially visual filmmaker, Kubrick always preferred to remain ambiguous in his statements about the meaning of his films. About 2001 he would state to Jerome Agel - “I don’t like to talk about 2001 too much because it’s essentially a non-verbal experience. It attempts to communicate more to the subconscious and to the feelings than it does to the intellect. I think clearly there’s a problem with people who are not paying attention with their eyes. They’re listening. And they don’t get much from listening to this film”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/clockwork-orange.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kubrick’s Clockwork Orange was so controversial the director had it withdrawn</div></figcaption></figure><p>Was this the same principle Kubrick followed when making The Shining? Was the literal meaning of the story, a caretaker who goes mad looking after a remote hotel, not what his film was about at all? Do we need to look more rather than listen?</p><p>1971’s A Clockwork Orange, a film about psychological conditioning and mind-control replete with illuminati and masonic symbolism, got somewhat overshadowed by the tabloid controversy over its violent content. But the film was about much more than violence; Kubrick even hid an all seeing eye atop a pyramid in its poster to hint as much.</p><p>The director’s last film was Eyes Wide Shut in 1999. A strange, disturbing work, tackling themes of obsession and identity and featuring a sinister secret society, some believe this was Kubrick's attempt to reveal dark truths about the establishment and their corruption, both sexual and spiritual.</p><p>Eyes Wide Shut appears to be a kind of culmination for Kubrick, a film where almost everything lies beneath the surface and nothing appears to be what it seems. The scope of the film warrants an entire separate article in itself, and indeed many books have been written attempting to decipher what the directors last, most mysterious work is really about.</p><p>Four days after he completed Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick died of a massive heart attack, prompting inevitably conspiracy theories that he had been killed by the very sinister forces he seemed to be trying to expose in the film. Whether coincidence or not, Kubrick himself might have appreciated that his death came exactly 666 days before the dawn of the new millenia on January 1st 2000.</p><p>The disclaimer here is, of course, not to get too carried away and see things that are not there. John Lennon famous deliberately put meaningless nonsense lyrics into Beatles songs because he enjoyed the incredibly elaborate theories their fans would spin about their ‘hidden’ meaning. It’s hard to imagine Kubrick himself would not have done the same.</p><p>But with  all this in mind, is there more than meets the eye in Kubrick’s only foray into horror?</p><h3>The Shining Code</h3><p>Much to author Stephen King's dismay, Kubrick removed much of what he saw as the central themes his book, retaining just a basic sketch of his story. Why the filmmaker chose King's novel at all for his next project puzzled many critics at the time.</p><p>Perhaps if Kubrick wanted to make some kind of obscure statement about the moon landings under the guise of a popular horror film, he simply chose The Shining for the punning name, as in the the Shining Moon. It seems unlikely, but then the cerebral Kubrick always loved puns and wordplay.</p><p>To further indulge the idea that Kubrick may have included subtle moon related wordplay in his film, we have the curious case of Billie Gibson. Gibson played the hideous crone who Jack Nicholson's character encounters in the bathroom of the mysterious room 237.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/ullman-manager.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The hotel’s manager may be a metaphor for the US Government</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whoever Billie Gibson was, she was not an actress. She has no other credits on IMDB other than this film. Some accounts have it that she was simply an old lady Kubrick knew, but why she was cast in one of the films most disturbing scenes remains a mystery.</p><p>Intriguingly, there is one other Bill Gibson listed on IMDB with only a single credit to his name. That credit is as the director of the official documentary of the Moon landings, 1969s ‘Footprints on the Moon: Apollo 11’.</p><p>Gibson is an obscure figure, what little information about him suggests he was a military photographer and filmmaker who worked for NASA in the 1960s. Kubrick, who collaborated closely with the space agency during the making of 2001, may well have known Gibson.</p><p>As we shall see later, the scene in The Shining in which the crone appears is the culmination of an unmistakable visual metaphor for the Apollo 11 mission. Could the casting of an unknown non-actress in the part with the same name as the director of ‘Footprints on the Moon’ really have been a coincidence or was it mischief on the part of Kubrick?</p><p>The theories presented in the film Room 237 and the work of Jay Weidner range from speculative film criticism to outrageous conspiracy theories. But Weidner's work in particular is of some use to us in search of further moon clues.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/danny-playing.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Danny playing with his toys during the Apollo launch sequence</div></figcaption></figure><p>The central thesis of his 2011 documentary Kubrick's Odyssey, that Kubrick had helped NASA to fake the moon landing footage and then put a coded confession to this in The Shining, is of course somewhat imaginative. But some of the evidence Weidner presents is nonetheless intriguing, whatever Kubrick's true motives may have been.</p><p>Kubrick's Odyssey argues that the father and son characters of Jack and Danny Torrance represent a duality within Kubrick himself. Danny the innocent boy with the unique gifts is Kubrick the creative genius, invited by NASA to take part in the biggest filmmaking challenge in history - faking the moon landing.</p><p>Whereas the dishevelled figure of struggling writer Jack and his terrible descent into madness represent the grim, corrupting reality and the toll Kubrick's part in the deception took on him. The directors continued use of mirrors and mirror images in the film might provide, at least on an artistic level, some further affirmation for this interpretation.</p><p>The long gaps between projects and his reclusive nature had long prompted rumours that Kubrick had gone mad; had the director hidden from the world because the guilt and paranoia about his role in the deception had become too much to bare? And was the madness of Jack Torrence Kubrick's coded allegory for his torment?</p><p>The theory that The Shining as a ‘mirror’ narrative of the Apollo program starts with the scene near the beginning of the film where Jack is interviewed for the caretaker's job at the Overlook hotel by its manager Stuart Ullman, played by Barry Nelson.</p><p>Weidner argues that the hotel manager represents John F Kennedy, the ‘manager’ of the USA when, as President in 1961, he initiated the Apollo program. Behind the hotel manager character in this scene is a window sill, representing a stage, and on that stage is a statue of an eagle, ‘Eagle’ being the name of the lunar lander.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/room237.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Does the sinister room 237 represent the Moon?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Does this scene represent a real event in Kubrick's life, when he was approached by the US government to participate in the filming of faked footage of the Apollo 11 moon landing?</p><p>Chronologically, Apollo followed a program named Gemini. In the film, Jack Torrance and his son replace a previous caretaker and his two daughters as the residents of the hotel during its off-season. If Jack and Danny represent Apollo, then it certainly seems apt that a man with twin daughters would represent Gemini, the star sign represented by twins.</p><p>That this is more than coincidence is suggested by a change Kubrick made to the book. In the original novel, the previous caretakers daughters are two sisters of different ages, whereas Kubrick consciously cast the parts as identical twins in the film, hiring identical twins Lisa and Louise Burns for the roles.</p><p>Jack’s descent into madness is finally revealed in one of the films most famous scenes. After typing away for hours in the hotels vast, cavernous central hallway, Wendy discovers all her husband has written is the phrase “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy” thousands of times.</p><p>On Jack’s old fashioned Adler typewriter, the characters of a lowercase l and a 1 are the same, indeed on old typewriters they were often the same key. Hence the phrase equally reads “A11 work and no play make jack a dull boy”. Is this yet another strange reference to the Apollo 11 mission, and even Kubrick's part in it?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/gemini-twins.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Do the twins represent the Gemini program?</div></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of this theory, the films pivotal scene is the extended sequence involving Jack’s young son Danny, which looks very much like a visual allegory of the Apollo mission itself.</p><p>Danny, who according to Jay Weidner represents the idealistic side of Kubrick that agreed to fake the moon landings for NASA, can be seen playing on the floor of one of the hotel’s labyrinthine corridors.</p><p>From above the gaudy 70s carpeting on the corridor looks, with its hexagonal patterning, a lot like aerial photos of the Saturn V rocket’s launch pad. Agitated by something in one of the hotel’s many empty rooms, Danny slowly rises to his feet, revealing he is wearing a knitted jumper featuring a Saturn V rocket and the words ‘Apollo 11’.</p><p>Clearly this is not some incidental costuming detail. Kubrick, a master of visual storytelling, can only be deliberately echoing the takeoff of the Apollo 11 mission in this sequence. The question is why? It doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the story and whilst it's always possible Kubrick did this simply because it looked interesting, that's seems at odds with this most calculating of filmmaker’s style.</p><p>After rising to his feet, Danny then proceeds slowly, as if mimicking an astronaut, across the corridor to one of the hotel’s rooms, specifically room 237.  If the metaphor is still intact, this room must represent the Moon itself. Could there be some clue in the number 237?</p><p>In King's novel, this room is actually room 217, but according to Kubrick's Odyssey this was changed to 237 in the film as Kubrick intended the room to be a hidden reference to the Moon, which is 237,000 miles away from the Earth.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/a11-work.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">On Jack’s old fashioned typewriter All also reads as A11</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst some critics argue that the Moon is actually 238,900 miles away from the Earth, the allusion is not entirely invalid. Some old science dictionaries and textbooks, which Kubrick may have used during his research for the film, do list the distance as 237,000 miles and Isaac Asimov's important 1972 article ‘The coming decades in space’ also uses the same figure.</p><p>What happens to Danny in room 237 is never shown, only the aftermath. Distressed and with his Apollo 11 jumper torn, Danny returns to his parents refusing to speak about what occurred. This certainly seems to fit Weidner's theorised hidden narrative that Danny represents a young Kubrick scarred by his involvement in the moon landing conspiracy.</p><p>But even if this is not the case, it's hard to escape the impression Kubrick is trying to tell us something in this sequence, some of the visual parallels are just too strong. Exactly what, of course, is very much open to interpretation.</p><p>The whole Apollo takeoff portion of the film concludes with Jack returning to room 237 to investigate exactly what had harmed his son. It is here that and he encounters the old crone played by the mysterious Billie Gibson and his spiral into madness accelerates, ultimately leading him to attempt to murder his wife and Danny.</p><p>Other more tenuous visual references to the the Apollo program are perhaps worth briefly mentioning. The large Native American totem murals that hang in the grand hallway of the hotel look decidedly like Saturn V rockets, whether coincidence or not. The film’s chilling sequence where rivers of blood are seem to spill out of the life shafts also bears a strong resemblance to a red hued version of the Saturn V’s fiery launch sequence.</p><p>The Shining ends with one final, esoteric moon reference. In the film’s closing shot of an old black and white photograph we see Jack Torrance at the centre of a crowd of party goers in the hotels ballroom. The photograph is, puzzlingly,  labelled ‘1921’, and how Jack could be present in a picture taken before he was born is not explained.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/jack-baphomat.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jack Torrance resembles Baphomet in the films closing sequence</div></figcaption></figure><p>Jack’s pose in this photograph echoes the traditional depiction of the medieval demonic idol Baphomet, one hand angled downwards and one upwards. The comparison is no doubt helped by Jacks Nicholsons famously devilish grin.</p><p>Baphomet features heavily in masonic symbolism and was said to be worshipped by the Knights Templar. The most common illustration of deity is by 19th century occultist Eliphas Levi and features the goat headed figure pointing directly at the moon.</p><h3>The Joker</h3><p>If we accept that there are references to Apollo and the moon landings in The Shining, the obvious question is why?</p><p>Speculation that Kubrick was involved in faking the Apollo missions is not new, sceptic Bill Kaysing had suggested the idea as early as the 1970s. As a one of the world's most prominent directors who had recently made a science fiction film with pioneering special effects, he would always look a likely candidate for role.</p><p>Did Kubrick simply insert some of this material into The Shining by way of a jokey acknowledgement of this? He may have found the whole idea that he was involved in susch an outlandish undertaking amusing, and wanted to tease conspiracy theorists further by giving them more material to work with.</p><p>Another more mundane explanation is that Kubrick, who had already worked closely with NASA during the making of  2001, did indeed work with them on some other entirely un-conspiratorial classified project. The director may have been forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement that forbid him to acknowledge his involvement.</p><p>The subtle nods in The Shining were therefore his playful way of breaking that agreement without getting into too much trouble.</p><p>That leaves us with one final, sensational alternative. Jay Weidner is right and Stanley Kubrick did indeed film the footage of mankind's greatest achievement on a Hollywood soundstage.</p><p>If The Shining is really his encoded confession to this, then it is surely one of the most artful and confounding confessions ever made.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Lunacy</h3><p>Critics argue that the elliptical, often surreal nature of Kubrick's work inherently lends itself to the kind of far out analysis given to it in documentaries like Kubrick's Odyssey and Room 237.</p><p>Room 237 itself is ample proof of this, containing as it does five radical interpretations of the film that have little to do with its overt horror plot. And this only scratches the surface, dozens of other theories have been posited over the years, on the internet and in books of film criticism.</p><p>Several key aspects of the theory expounded by Kubrick's Odyssey have been questioned by sceptics, not least the identification of Room 237 with the moon. The idea that Kubrick changed this from 217 to 237 in order to represent the moon looks to be overreaching in light of Kubrick's own more banal explanation in an interview with Michel Ciment at the time of the films release.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/diane-arbus-twins-shining.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kubrick based his twins on this photo by Diane Arbus</div></figcaption></figure><p>The director was simply asked by the management of the The Timberline Lodge in Oregon, which doubles as the exterior of the Overlook hotel in The Shining, to change the malevolent room in King's novel to the non-existent room 237 in order to avoid putting off superstitious guests.</p><p>Of course even if this is true, and we must remember Kubrick also denied that HAL was a sly joke at the expense of computer giant IBM, it wouldn't preclude the possibility it was actually this request that gave him the idea to use 237 as the room number in the first place.</p><p>The change from sisters to twins is also cited as a reference to the Apollo precursor program Gemini, but could equally just be because it makes for a more sinister image in a horror film. The creepy look of the twins in the film is actually based on a well known photograph by Diane Arbus that predates both the book and film.</p><p>The closing image of Jack Torrance in what appears to be a pose similar to moon deity was also not created especially for the film, Kubrick instead airbrushed Nicholson’s face into an old stock photograph of a group of party revellers from 1923.</p><p>Whatever the truth about these references, it’s entirely unclear what any of them really mean. And if there wasn't already an existing conspiracy theory that Stanley Kubrick had helped NASA fake the moon landings it seems unlikely anybody would have made any connections between The Shining and Apollo in the first place.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/kubrick-apollo-conspiracy-under-a-shining-moon/shining-photograph-original.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jack Nicholson was airbrushed into an old black and white photograph</div></figcaption></figure><p>As such an iconic historical event, and an integral piece of modern American culture, the  Apollo program is part of the widely recognised bank of shared imagery many artists and filmmakers dip into, not just Kubrick.

A personal confession to a dark secret or the tale of a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel, and any number of possibilities in between. The truth, if there is one, went with Kubrick to his grave.</p><p>But like any work of art, truth is also something invested into it by the viewer.

It is our opinion the same pattern was repeated, except for the rescue”, it concluded.</p><p>Some, however, were less sure the tragic star’s death was suicide. Numerous suspicious inconsistencies and contradictory witness testimony have fueled persistent rumors that the star was actually murdered.</p><p>The first policeman to arrive — Sergeant Jack Clemmons, wasn’t called until 4:25am, more than 30 minutes after Monroe was pronounced dead. This unexplained delay in calling the police was just the first troubling detail of the crime scene.</p><p>Clemmons immediately felt something was wrong — he thought it obvious the body had been moved.

Was it to conceal a cleanup of the crime scene? Or worse?</p><p>Sergeant Jack Clemmons, the first policeman at the scene, was called out at 4:25am. He was immediately suspicious that the crime scene had been altered.</p><p>According to Clemmons, the body looked to be in an unnatural position as if it had been posed, the bedroom was strangely tidy and most mysterious of all, there was no glass.</p><p>Monroe had supposedly swallowed upwards of 60 pills, but there was no water or glass in the bedroom. The actress had always had trouble swallowing pills and required copious amounts of water.</p><p>And why, Clemmons wondered, was Eunice Murray running the washer and drier in the middle of the night, as her employer lay dead in her bedroom?</p><p>There was clearly a problem with the story coming out of the house. And more evidence would emerge to cast doubt on what the trio were saying.</p><p>According to Natalie Trundy, she was attending a Hollywood bowl concert with her future husband Arthur Jacobs, who was Monroe's agent at the time.</p><p>Jacob’s received a call from Monroe’s lawyer Mickey Rudin and it was shocking.

Was there a cover-up, and what was its purpose?</p><p>Eunice Murray’s accounts of what happened that night have been contradictory and evasive over the years.</p><p>According to author and investigative journalist Anthony Summers, Murray finally came clean to him about what really happened in an interview in 1985.</p><p>The reason for the cover story, Murray told Summers, was because Robert Kennedy was at the house that day. And an ambulance had been called much earlier when Marilyn was still alive.</p><p>Summers asked her why she had lied. “I told whatever I thought was good to tell”, Murray told him.</p><h3>Bobby Kennedy</h3><p>Attorney General Robert Kennedy was, officially, In San Francisco on the day of Monroe’s death. But Eunice Murray’s shocking revelation to Summers was not the only evidence that this was a lie.</p><p>20th Century Fox publicist Frank Neill saw Kennedy arrive by helicopter at the studio’s heliport near Stage 14 early Saturday afternoon, where he was whisked away in a limousine driven by his brother in law, actor Peter Lawford.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/marilyn-monroe-killing-the-legend/marilyn-monroe-robert-kennedy-john-f-kennedy.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robert Kennedy and his brother pictured with Marilyn Monroe in 1962</div></figcaption></figure><p>This limousine was later stopped by Beverly Hills traffic policeman Lynn Franklin, who says he observed Lawford at the wheel and Robert Kennedy in the back with a man he later identified as Ralph Greenson.</p><p>Whilst these sightings of Kennedy could perhaps be dismissed as hearsay, they were confirmed by LA Police chief Daryl Gates and other senior LA Police Detectives through their surveillance of the airport.</p><blockquote><span>\"The truth is, we knew Robert Kennedy was in town on August 4th\"</span><br><cite>Daryl Gates</cite></blockquote><p>“The truth is, we knew Robert Kennedy was in town on August 4th”, Gates later said. “We always knew when he was in town”.</p><p>Kennedy, it seems, was certainly in LA that day and lied about it. Could there be another reason, unrelated to Monroe, for him to be there that he didn’t want to disclose?</p><p>Some have speculated that Kennedy may have been meeting with mob bosses and this was his reason for lying. However, there are reasons to doubt this was the case.</p><p>Kennedy was seen in the presence of actor Peter Lawford, a friend of Monroe's. And numerous witnesses place him at her house on the day and even night of her death. Whatever his reason for being there, it seemed to center on the actress.</p><p>Aside from Eunice Murray statement to Summers in 1985, there are several other reasons to believe Robert Kennedy visited Marilyn that day.</p><p>Murray’s son in law Norman Jefferies confirmed Murray’s story. Kennedy had arrived that afternoon with Peter Lawford and there had been a violent argument between him and Monroe.</p><p>According to Jeffries, Kennedy came back with 2 men at around 10pm, a fact confirmed by neighbors opposite who also saw Kennedy enter the property with the 2 men.</p><p>This is where the case against Robert Kennedy takes a very dark turn. Jeffries and Murray were ordered out of the house. After Kennedy and the men left, they re-entered the house to find Marilyn comatose in the guest bedroom.</p><p>What was the purpose of Robert Kennedy's visit to Monroe’s house? And was he really responsible for her death?</p><p>One obvious motive was Marilyn’s threats to go to the press over her relationship with Bobby and his brother President Kennedy. This could have destroyed both men’s careers.</p><p>Even worse was the diary she was said to keep. In it was not only the scandalous details of her sexual adventures with the two men, but incriminating accounts of conversations she had had with them about the plot to murder Castro.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/marilyn-monroe-killing-the-legend/robert-kennedy-marilyn-monroe-affair.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robert Kennedy was, like his brother, having an affair with Monroe</div></figcaption></figure><p>Marilyn had become a security risk. Furthermore, her relationship with a Mexican man who was a suspected communist agent had piqued the interest of the FBI.</p><p>One way or the other, the star had become a major security risk. Did Bobby Kennedy take matters in his own hands and attempt to persuade Marilyn to hand over the diary and keep her mouth shut?</p><p>Evidence supports this scenario. According to Norman Jeffries, Monroe's filing cabinet had been broken into on the night of her death. Had Kennedy been searching for the diary?</p><p>Private Eye Robert Otash claimed to have bugged Monroe house, probably on behalf of the FBI. Papers that emerged after Otash’s death reveal sensational details about what he had heard.</p><p>Recounting Kennedy's visit to Monroe on the day of the murder, Otash described a violent struggle between the pair. Kennedy was heard to shout ‘where is it?’, whilst Monroe complained about her treatment by him and his brother.</p><p>Had Kennedy and the men he was with deliberately murdered Monroe or had an attempt to restrain or sedate her gone badly wrong?</p><p>It’s difficult to reconcile the image of the inspiring, progressive Robert Kennedy with a murder so grubby and desperate. But the evidence he was present at her home that fateful day is persuasive.</p><p>And soon after, Marilyn Monroe was dead.</p><h3>Autopsy</h3><p>The coroner's report labeled Marilyn Monroe’s death a ‘probable suicide’, indicating even they were not quite sure what had happened.</p><p>The toxicology reports finding suggested she had died of a massive overdose of barbiturates. The amount of pentobarbital in her blood was 3 times the fatal dose. There were also large concentrations of the drug in her liver.</p><p>It is estimated she would have had to take somewhere between 25–50 of her Nembutal pills to reach these levels. On top of this there were also near lethal levels of Chloral Hydrate in her blood, accounting for almost 20 capsules of the drug.</p><p>The enduring medical mystery behind the death of Marilyn Monroe is how these drugs got into her body. At her autopsy, not a trace of the drugs or pill capsules were found in her stomach.</p><p>It has been argued that the yellow Nembutal pill wrappings could have broken down and left no trace in the stomach. But Thomas Noguchi, the pathologist, could find no traces of the fine refractive crystals which should also have been present.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1241\" height=\"1069\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/marilyn-monroe-killing-the-legend/thomas-noguchi-marilyn-monroe.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Legendary Hollywood coroner Thomas Noguchi found no evidence of drugs in Monroe’s stomach</div></figcaption></figure><p>In a standard textbook on drug-related deaths, toxicologist Robert H. Cravey studied over 1500 cases. “In every case of a drug overdose through oral entry I have always found drugs in the stomach”, Cravey said.</p><p>The findings from the autopsy only echoed odd details from the crime scene. Jack Clemmons, the first police officer to arrive at Monroe’s house, could find no glass or water in her bedroom. How had Monroe swallowed so many pills without water?</p><p>The police report also noted the lack of vomit, which would be expected from someone who had orally overdosed on barbiturates. Also missing was the acrid pear-like odor characteristic of Chloral Hydrate overdoses.</p><p>With no evidence that Monroe had injected the drugs, this left a real mystery. Clearly, if she hadn’t administered the substances herself, then it could not be suicide.</p><p>John W. Miner, former deputy district attorney of LA Country, was present at the autopsy. He believes Marilyn may have been killed by an enema, with 30 or more of the Nembutal dissolved in water and administered anally.</p><p>If Miner is right, then whoever administered the enema was Monroe’s killer.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Mental health</h3><p>Marilyn Monroe was one of Hollywood’s brightest and most vivacious stars. Few would suspect that beyond the glamor she was plagued by intense feelings of isolation, inadequacy, and loneliness.</p><p>She once wrote — “Help help Help I feel life coming closer When all I want is to die”. Playwright Arthur Miller, Monroe’s 3rd husband, once described her as ‘the saddest person I know’.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/marilyn-monroe-killing-the-legend/marilyn-monroe-young-starlet.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Monroe as a young starlet, but behind the smiles lay a tragic private life</div></figcaption></figure><p>Marilyn Monroe was born in 1926. She never knew her father, a fact which preoccupied her for much of her life.</p><p>Her mother, Gladys, suffered from mental illness and depression which led to the young Marilyn spending much of her early life in foster homes.</p><p>In some of these foster homes, Monroe was sexually abused. She was brave enough to tell of the abuse but was not believed by those she trusted. This double trauma had a profound effect on her adult life.</p><p>She would continually seek father figures, her 3 marriages were all to older men and Clark Gable, her much older co-star in the Misfits, was someone she clung on to.</p><p>Many psychologists think Monroe’s promiscuity and constant search for father figures were down to her traumatic childhood experiences. Her behavior also had classic hallmarks of suicide.</p><p>Sexual abuse, abandonment, isolation and a family history of mental health issues are all warning signals. Indeed, Monroe had attempted suicide on numerous occasions when she was younger.</p><p>She tried to kill herself twice when she was a teenager during her marriage to James Dougherty. She tried again in 1950 after a failed relationship. Another suicide was attempted during her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller.</p><p>Many psychologists today believe Monroe suffered from bipolar disorder — a syndrome characterized by extreme shifts in mood. This, along with her chronic insomnia and drug use are classic risk factors for suicide.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/marilyn-monroe-killing-the-legend/marilyn-monroe-arthur-miller.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Monroe attempted suicide whilst married to playwright Arthur Miller</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hollywood columnist James Bacon saw Marilyn just days before her death. “She was drinking champagne and straight vodka and occasionally popping a pill,” Bacon told The LA Times.</p><p>“I said, ‘Marilyn, the combination of pills and alcohol will kill you.’ And she said, ‘It hasn’t killed me yet.’ Then she took another drink and popped another pill.

All we know is he was heading to his death.</p><p>The man's strange demise on the beach at Somerton would spawn Australia's greatest unsolved mystery, a secret code that remains unbroken to this day and persistent rumours of Cold War intrigue and spying.</p><p>The story begins on the morning of December the 1st 1948 at a beach near Glenelg, seven miles from the South Australian city of Adelaide. Local jeweller John Lyons had become concerned about a man he had seen the previous evening laying fully clothed on the sand propped up against the sea wall.</p><p>Lyons had initially dismissed the slumbering figure as a drunk sleeping off a rough session, but the next morning he was still there. Cold and pale, an extinguished half smoked cigarette resting on his shirt collar, the man was clearly dead.</p><p>Lyons alerted the police; If this unfortunate soul was a drunk his hangover had proven terminal. But it seemed unlikely even at first glance, the man was clearly no vagrant as he was well dressed in a suit, pullover and tie and what looked like freshly polished shoes.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/location-of-body-crippled-childrens-home.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The man's body was found on Somerton beach opposite the children's home</div></figcaption></figure><p>What initially might have been something relatively straightforward like illness or suicide quickly became a whole lot more complex and puzzling by the troubling details of the man's death.</p><p>Somerton man, as he became known for reasons about to become clear, was about 45 years old, in excellent physical condition, with unusually well defined and muscular calfs and smooth well-manicured hands. </p><p>Found on his person was some Juicy Fruit chewing gum, a couple of combs, a box of Army Club cigarettes with more expensive Kensitas cigarettes inside, a used bus ticket to Glenelg and an unused train ticket to nearby Henley beach.</p><p>The trouble for the police was that was it. Aside from this small assortment of items, the body was entirely and utterly anonymous. No wallet, passport or identification documents. Strangest of all, the labels in his clothing had been deliberately removed.</p><p>Whoever Somerton man was, he either wanted to remain anonymous or somebody had stripped the body of any form of identification. If the case wasn't already difficult enough for the Adelaide police, no cause of death could be ascertained either.</p><p>There were no marks on the body or signs of a struggle and the autopsy revealed he had not died of a heart attack or other natural causes. There was, however, signs of damage to his organs - the brain, stomach and liver were congested with blood leading the pathologist to suspect he had died as the result of hemorrhaging caused by poison.</p><p>The pathologists were puzzled. It was the only explanation for his death they could come up with but even this made no sense. Absolutely no traces of poison were found in the man's body and there were no signs of convulsing or vomiting at the scene. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-at-morgue.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">No obvious cause of death was found when Somerton man's body was examined</div></figcaption></figure><p>If this was a poisoning then it was a very sophisticated one, using a rare poison that left no trace, odd for small town Australia in the 1940s. It also looked like murder rather than suicide as the body's peaceful and undisturbed state when discovered suggested it had been moved into position after the poison had taken effect.</p><p>Whatever the case, it appeared the work of professionals. The stripping of identification from the body, the removal of all the tags from his clothing, the signs of a sophisticated, traceless poison; it all pointed to the world of espionage.  Was Somerton man a spy? </p><p>A few scant leads emerged. A couple of locals suggested he was a man named E.C. Johnson, but when Johnson promptly walked into Adelaide police station alive and well that possibility evaporated. All other enquiries proved fruitless. Even searches as far afield as the UK and US returned nothing.</p><p>Just days after Somerton man's discovery, the case was as cold as the body on the slab. No name, no clues, a dead end. On December 10th the body was embalmed, the first time anyone could remember this happening to an unidentified person.</p><p>For the next six weeks, Somerton man was little more than a local curiosity, all enquiries exhausted. Then, on January 14th 1949, a breakthrough was made when staff at Adelaide train station finally made a connection between media reports of the mystery man found at Somerton and an unclaimed suitcase that had been resting in their cloakroom since December.</p><p>Inside the suitcase police found clothes similar to those Somerton man had been wearing. The dates checked out too, as it had been deposited at the station the day before the man's body had been found. A distinctive yarn of orange barbour waxed thread inside the suitcase clinched it - the same orange thread had been used to repair the pocket of Somerton man's trousers. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-suitcase.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Somerton Man's suitcase and personal affects discovered at Adelaide train station</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was his suitcase alright; were police finally about to solve the mystery? Unfortunately, the contents of the suitcase were of little help in identifying Somerton man. If anything, what was inside only deepened the mystery.</p><p>It was mostly the kind of mundane stuff you'd expect in a suitcase - a dressing gown, a pair of trousers, a pair of slippers, underpants and pajamas, shaving equipment, pencils, envelopes and stamps. More interesting was a knife and scissors, a square of zinc and a stencilling brush of the kind used by seaman to mark cargo on merchant ships. </p><p>Perhaps Somerton man was a foreign sailor? It certainly seemed he was not Australian, or if he was he was a frequent traveller abroad. Both the barber thread and the man's coat were of a kind not sold in Australia. </p><p>Ominously, like the clothes the man was wearing, almost everything in the suitcase had had its label deliberately mutilated. There were, however, a couple of notable exceptions. A washbag bore a label with the name 'T. Keane' on it and the name 'Kean' was found on a singlet.</p><p>Whilst this was an important clue, investigating detectives Lionel Leane and Len Brown were confused. Why had all the other labels been so meticulously removed yet these left intact? They felt the distinct possibility that somebody was deliberately trying to mislead them.</p><p>Regardless, a search for T Keane and Kean in missing persons records in the whole English speaking world returned nothing. One possibility was the man was from the Eastern Bloc, whose records were off limits to Western investigators with the onset of the Cold War.</p><p>Again, it looked like the police had reached another dead end. After six months with no further leads, a coroner's inquest into the mystery man's death finally commenced on June 7th 1949.  With little new evidence to go on it came to much the same conclusion reached back in December. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-detectives-and-suitcase.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Detectives Dave Bartlett and Lionel Leane examine Somerton man's suitcase</div></figcaption></figure><p>Pathologist John Burton Cleland stated, \"I would be prepared to find that he died from poison, that the poison was probably a glucoside and that it was not accidentally administered; but I cannot say whether it was administered by the deceased himself or by some other person.\"</p><p>Despite the inconclusive verdict, a major discovery was made at the inquest; initially missed by the pathologists was a small scrap of paper hidden inside the fob watch pocket of Somerton man's trousers. It would change the whole complexion of the case.</p><p>It was torn out from a page of a book of poetry called the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and contained the phrase 'Tamám Shud'. The Rubaiyat itself is concerned with the themes of seizing every day and leaving behind no regrets. Tellingly, Tamam Shud  means 'ended' or 'finished' in Persian. The implication that Somerton man had used the book as an impetus to suicide is obvious. </p><p>Police went to the media with the new finding in the hope that somebody would be able to identify the book the scrap had been torn from. They were soon contacted by a man, who wished to remain anonymous, who had found a rare 1859 Edward FitzGerald translation of the Rubaiyat on the back seat of his unlocked car which had been parked in Glenelg around the time the body was found.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/paper-tamam-shud.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The scrap of paper torn from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</div></figcaption></figure><p>Forensic experts matched the torn scrap to a page from the book, but nobody had any idea why it had been ripped out or indeed why it had been sewn into the man's trousers. None of it made any sense.</p><p>It is probably the discovery of the book more than anything else that ensures we're still talking about Somerton man 70 years later.  It would turn an obscure John Doe case into one of the most baffling and intriguing mysteries of the entire Cold War. And like many great mysteries, this one had a secret code.</p><p>Aside from the torn out scrap, the forensic experts also found very faint letters written in pencil on the book's inside cover. It looked like some kind of code or cipher:</p><p>Also written in the book was something less cryptic, an unlisted telephone number that belonged to a local nurse named Jessica Thomson. Thompson lived less than a mile from where Somerton man's body was found and was clearly connected to the dead man in some way. </p><p>At the time of the police inquiry, Thompson requested and was granted anonymity by the police, and was referred to for many years only by the name 'Jestyn'.</p><p>The detectives who interviewed Thompson noted her evasive manner, seeming reluctant to offer up any information about what, if anything, she knew. Most startling was her reaction when shown a plaster cast of the dead man's face. Thompson was visibly shocked and was described by detectives present as \"completely taken aback, to the point of giving the appearance that she was about to faint.\" </p><p>Despite this extraordinary reaction, Jessica Thompson claimed not to recognize Somerton man, but did tell police that she too had once owned a copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Thompson had worked as a nurse in Sydney during WW2 and recalls giving her copy of the book to an army lieutenant she had met there called Alf Boxall. Was this a tale of an old love tracking down his wartime sweetheart in the hope of a reconciliation? </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/rubaiyat-cipher-taman-shud.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The cipher found in the Rubaiyat has never been broken</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hoping they might finally be closing in on the solution to the mystery, and the identity of Somerton man, police attempted to track Boxall down. Unfortunately for them but fortunately for Boxall, they found him alive and well and living in Syndey. </p><p>Boxall still had his copy of the Rubaiyat, complete with the intact page bearing the phrase Tamam Shud and signed with 'Jestyn', Thompson's pseudonymous name.  Boxall claimed no knowledge of the dead man and said he had not had any contact with Thompson after 1945. </p><p>Clearly Thompson and Boxall were not been entirely honest. Two copies of a book of poetry, owned by two men, both inscribed with direct references to the same woman. There had to be a connection and some of the detectives' long held suspicions about the case began to become manifest.</p><p>The code, the missing labels and the air of mystery surrounding the dead man raised the possibility his death was espionage related, and he himself may even have been a spy. Did Thompson and Boxall know more than they were letting on? Were they both spies themselves, unable to tell police what they knew because it was top secret? </p><p>That there might be darker forces at work here was reinforced by the discovery of another similar death in 1945 were a Sydney man named George Marshall also died, supposedly from poisoning, clutching a copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Was the book some kind of standard issue for spies? Was it used for identification or as a book cipher?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/jessica-thompson-jestyn.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jessica Thompson, aka 'jestyn' with her son Robin circa the late 1940s</div></figcaption></figure><p>Australia in the post-war period was thick with espionage. The UK and US both suspected the Soviets of operating agents in the country, which housed such highly sensitive installations as the top secret British rocket and nuclear test base Woomera, 300 miles north of Somerton.</p><p>The spying thesis was clearly credible, and the suspicious silence of those involved only reinforced the idea. But after failing to get anywhere with Boxall, and with Thompson no help, the case eventually went cold. Interest would periodically be revived, with dozens of people over the years coming forward claiming to know who Somerton man was, but on every single occasion the leads amounted to nothing.</p><p>Much later, in the 1970s, Alf Boxall would be interviewed on Australian TV. Whilst admitting he had been involved in intelligence during the war, he denied there was any spying connection in the Somerton man case, stating, \"It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?</p><blockquote><span>\"It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?\"</span><br><cite>Alf Boxall</cite></blockquote><p>But Boxall's attempts to downplay the idea have had little effect on its enduring popularity and the case has never been far from the public consciousness in Australia.  Rumours that this was an untold and still untellable story of Cold War intrigue persists to this day.</p><p>Was the nameless, mystery man found on Somerton beach really a spy, killed in the course of some clandestine mission?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Spy Game</h3><p>Several aspects of the Somerton man case are suggestive of spying. Whilst innocent interpretations can perhaps be found for each, when taken as a whole it's difficult to justify an alternative explanation.</p><p>As discussed, the lack of documents and the removal and mutilation of the man's clothing labels look like an attempt to obfuscate his identity. However, it seems unlikely Somerton man himself would have done this. If he was a spy or undertaking some kind of criminal activity, it would have been necessary to assume a false identity rather than be entirely anonymous.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/jestyn-message.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Alf Boxall's copy of the Rubaiyat contained a handwritten message from Jessica Thompson</div></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, it seems the stripping of Somerton man's identity was done by a third party seeking to ensure the man's death would leave a dead end for investigators. Clearly, there is a strong likelihood whoever did this was also responsible for his death. </p><p>In the pre-DNA era and with the absence of any witnesses, an anonymous victim would be almost impossible for the police to identify. This also ensures no motive for the death can be ascertained and no possible likely perpetrators.</p><p>The method of the man's death also signals this case out as something more than a regular suicide or murder. The original investigators in 1948 were sure he had been poisoned but were unable to ascertain exactly how and with what substance. The murder had been committed with such skill and with a poison that was sufficiently obscure and untraceable that it singled out the perpetrators as professionals.</p><p>A more recent examination of the case in 1994 reasoned the poison was probably digitalis. John Harber Phillips, Chief Justice of Victoria and Chairman of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, reviewed the case to determine the cause of death and, noting the engorgement of the man's organs, concluded that \"There seems little doubt it was digitalis.\"</p><p>However,  other experts are skeptical that digitalis was used in this instance. Whilst it is possible to use digitalis as an 'untraceable' poison, this is mainly due to its ability to mimic a heart attack coupled with its widespread use as heart medication. This had led to some murders been overlooked by pathologists as overdoses of legitimate prescriptions.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-funeral.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Somerton man's funeral</div></figcaption></figure><p>In actual fact, digitalis is not innately difficult to detect and would have probably been discovered in Somerton man's case as his death was suspicious and unexplained. If he was poisoned it was, therefore, more likely to be something more obscure and esoteric that would not be detected without prior knowledge of its use.</p><p>Since the 1920s, the KGB had been experimenting with producing exactly such poisons. The infamous Laboratory No 12 was originally set up by Lenin in 1921 and expanded its remit under Stalin in the 1940s. It was specifically tasked with producing unique and untraceable substances, often by combining known poisons in unusual ways with the specific intention of mimicking natural causes and baffling forensic investigators. Undoubtedly, the western agencies had similar departments.</p><p>Was Somerton man killed by one of these exotic poisons? Perhaps the mystery man was a double agent whose treachery had been discovered by the Soviets or even a Soviet agent whose operation in Australia was discovered by Western intelligence. Even the suggestion a country had been penetrated by foreign intelligence could do so much damage that it would routinely be covered up, providing a satisfactory explanation as to why Somerton man had been stripped of all identification.</p><p>It is perhaps the book and cipher that is most redolent of spying, evoking as it does countless fictional tales of espionage. The five line, 50 character message has prompted endless debate over the years, with many amateur code breakers and even department of defence cryptologists attempting to discern its meaning. So far all have failed and it's true purpose and intent remain unknown to this day.</p><p>Some have speculated it is not a cipher at all, but some kind of mnemonic or acrostic. If the message is in English, then linguistic analysis of the text conducted by Professor Derek Abbott at Adelaide University reveal its more likely that the letter frequencies of the message correspond to the first letters of English words rather than normal English text.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-fingerprints.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Somerton Man's fingerprints matched nobody on file in the Western world</div></figcaption></figure><p>Others believe the text is merely gibberish, the fevered product of a disturbed mind. Whatever the case, its placement in a book of poetry is almost more interesting. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is clearly significant as it appears three times in this story. Was it being used as a book cipher?</p><p>When the Australian Navy cryptographic department examined the letters, they came to just that conclusion, \"a reasonable explanation would be that the lines are the initial letters of words of a verse of poetry or such like.\"</p><p>A book cipher has been a common spy technique as long as books have existed. The essential principle is that the key to the code in question is a section of text in a book or other commonly available published material. If a book is used, it is usually required that both sides of the communication use the same edition.</p><p>In the American Revolution, Benedict Arnold used such a book cipher, known as the Arnold Cipher, with Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England acting as the key.</p><p>Had the Rubaiyat of Omar Kayam been used as the key in some spy ring operating in Australia? The book crops up no less than three times - the copy linked to the dead man by the scrap of paper bearing the phrase Tamam Shud, the copy Jessica Thompson says she gave to Alf Boxall, and the copy found clutched to the dead body of George Marshall in Sydney in 1945.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/rare-copy-of-rubaiyat.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The unique copy of the Rubaiyat from which the phrase Tamam Shud was torn out</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst this collection of 11th-century Persian poetry is a common one, the editions in this case were far from ordinary. The Somerton man edition was an extremely rare 1859 translation by Edward Fitzgerald. So rare in fact, that when author and former policeman Gerry Feltus led an exhaustive global search for other copies the closest he was able to get was a similar Whitcombe & Tombs version that was published in a squarer format.</p><p>The George Marshall version was even stranger, not so much rare as apparently none existent. His copy claimed to be a seventh edition published in London by Methuen, but records reveal no such edition was ever produced, the Methuen run ending at the fifth.</p><p>George Marshall's curious death also provides a link to the third copy of the book. Marshall died of an apparent suicide by poisoning in Sydney in 1945, close to where Jessica Thompson and Alfred Boxall were working at the time and the same year Thompson gave her copy of the Rubaiyat to Boxall.</p><p>It looks far more than coincidence that the book crops up so often and that the editions involved are so peculiar and suspicious. Could it be they were actually not genuine copies of the book at all but espionage paraphernalia designed to be used as book-ciphers or one-time pads? </p><p>A one-time pad is an additional, entirely random one-off key that makes a cipher essentially uncrackable. They were often employed in the Cold War by Soviet spies operating in America to secretly communicate with their Russian embassies and consulates. There is not a single instance of any of the American intelligence agencies managing to crack such a code.</p><p>Jessica Thompson and Alf Boxall's role in the story of Somerton man have also caused many to suspect their involvement in espionage. Boxall admitted in the 1970s he was involved in intelligence during the war and in recent years, Thompson's daughter Kate has stated she now believes her mother was a Russian spy.</p><blockquote><span>\"There's always that fear that I've thought that maybe she was responsible for his death.\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>\"She had a dark side, a very strong dark side,\" Kate told Australian current affairs show 60 Minutes. \"She said to me she, she knew who he was but she wasn't going to let that out of the bag so to speak. There's always that fear that I've thought that maybe she was responsible for his death.\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/peter-helen-kroger.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Morris and Lona Cohen, aka Peter and Helen Kroger, were Russian sleeper agents who operated in the UK for many years</div></figcaption></figure><p>Kate Thompson also revealed how her mother spoke Russian and would hint that the Somerton man mystery was \"above state police level\". If Kate Thompson's suspicion about her mother are correct they have particularly dark implications considering both Somerton Man and George Marshall died in strange circumstances within a mile of where Jessica Thompson was living at the time.</p><p>There are many examples of Russian sleeper agents living normal lives in the West for years and decades entirely unsuspected by those around them. The Portland spy ring in the UK in the 1950s involved several Soviet agents conducting normal lives as British citizens and American couple Richard and Cynthia Murphy lived in suburban New Jersey for 15 years before been exposed as Russian spies Lydia and Vladimir Guryev in 2010.</p><p>Was Jessica Thompson such a sleeper agent, operating silently in Australia for decades?</p><h3>The Hot Cold War</h3><p>Although far from the Western theatre of the Cold War, Australia was a hotbed of espionage activity in the post-war period, with it playing a key strategic role for both the US and the UK in the period following WW2.</p><p>Both countries were concerned about the security of intelligence in the country. Shortly after the war, the joint US-UK counterintelligence programme Venona discovered a leak operating out of Canberra which was passing sensitive government secrets back to the Soviets.</p><p>Because of this and other incidents, a dedicated Australian intelligence organisation was formed - the ASIO, closely modelled on the FBI and Britain's MI5. The latter agency was especially influential, providing much of the initial personnel and expertise on ASIO's formation.</p><p>It was around the time of Somerton man's death that the MI5 team was in Australia to consult over the creation of the ASIO, and the new agency operated an office out of Adelaide close to where the body was found. Was there a connection?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/petrov-defection.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The defection of Vladimir Petrov was a major coup for ASIO</div></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the MI5 delegation such as Roger Hollis and Robert Hemblys-Scales were suspected of been Soviet agents themselves, and the ASIO would later have its own problems with Soviet moles. The ACP - Australian Communist Party, was also viewed with suspicion by the Americans due to its susceptibility to Russian infiltration.</p><p>The ASIO orchestrated defection of Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov in 1954 also provided a great deal of new intelligence about Russian spying in both the United States and Australia, including the long suspected spy ring operating from the ACP. </p><p>With the country playing such an important strategic role for the Western powers, initially as the home of the UK's top secret nuclear and rocket testing base at Woomera, then as a key part of the Cold War Five Eyes surveillance programme, it's inevitable there were active intelligence networks been run by both sides in the country.</p><p>Whether Somerton man, Jessica Thompson and Alf Boxall were some small cog in those operations we may never know. Whilst much of the evidence is circumstantial and suggestive, there are enough fingerprints of espionage in their story to suspect they were.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Affairs of the heart</h3><p>An alternative way to look at the strange case of Somerton man is not as a story from the pages of spy fiction but one from the pages of romance. At least some of the evidence can be fit into a scenario of unrequited love, a WW2 dalliance that ended in tragedy on Somerton beach three years later.</p><p>There is some reason to believe somebody was looking for Jessica Thompson the day before Somerton man died. A witness who came forward several years later recalled a man knocking on her door the day before Somerton man was found.</p><p>Since we know Jessica Thompson was in the habit of giving copies of the Rubaiyat to men she knew, and Somerton Man's copy contained her unlisted telephone number, it's safe to assume the two were acquainted. It's possible the man was a foreign sailor judging by the stencilling brush found in his suitcase, an item used to stencil cargo on merchant ships. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/somerton-man-ear.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Somerton man's ears had distinctive enlarged upper portions and diagonal ear creases</div></figcaption></figure><p>At some point in the previous few years the pair may have and had a romantic liaison. For some reason they were parted and Thompson gave Somerton man a copy of the Rubaiyat as a keepsake of their time together.</p><p>An intriguing additional possibility is that Somerton man fathered Thompson's young son Robin, who was 18 months old in 1948. Several investigators have pointed to a couple of unusual features of the man's ears, an enlarged upper cymba and a diagonal ear crease, clearly present in the morgue photos and drawings of his corpse. These features are present in only around 1% of the population and are also evident in Robin. Was Somerton man his father?</p><p>The main issue with this scenario is how and why Somerton man ended up dead. Although the pasty found in his stomach was dismissed at the time as the cause of the man's death, Nick Pelling on his blog ciphermysteries.com suggests the excessive sulphites used as preservatives in baked goods in 1948 may have caused an extreme allergic reaction.</p><p>This might initially seem far-fetched, but it was clear from the autopsy that Somerton man was probably recovering from a serious illness when he died. His enlarged spleen is unlikely to have suddenly occurred on the day and is more suggestive of him having recently suffered from something like mononucleosis or malaria.</p><p>Pelling theorises that in his already frail state our man became ill after consuming the pasty at Jessica Thompson's house, lay down to try and sleep it off and died. This scenario fits the autopsy evidence which noted the lividity at the back of the man's neck, something unlikely to have occurred if he died whilst sat propped against the seawall where he was found. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/body-on-beach.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The evidence suggested Somerton man's body was placed on the beach after his death</div></figcaption></figure><p>It's possible Thompson then persuaded a male friend to move the body onto the beach to make it look like he died there, presumably to save the embarrassment and difficulty of having to explain how a strange man was found dead in her house. A witness who came forward much later in the 1950s did indeed claim to see a man on the beach carrying another man over his shoulder at some point on the evening before Somerton man was found dead, so there is some corroborating evidence for the idea.</p><p>Whilst clearly speculation, the general scenario has some merit and cannot be discounted. The main objections are the lack of credible explanations for the book and code, and the inability to ever identify the dead man. If this was simply an innocuous domestic incident then why has Somerton man resisted identification for nearly 70 years?</p><h3>HC Reynolds</h3><p>In recent years, a new theory has emerged as to the identity of Somerton man. In 2011, a woman approached Adelaide based biological anthropologist Professor Maciej Henneberg with an old military service card that had belonged to her father. The US seaman's ID card featured the picture of an 18-year-old British man named H.C. Reynolds.</p><p>According to Henneberg, the man pictured on the card is probably the same man found on the beach at Somerton. \"It's not just about an exact image...there is a close similarity of the ear, and ears don't change.\"</p><blockquote><span>\"It's not just about an exact image...there is a close similarity of the ear, and ears don't change.\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Henneberg noted several other similarities in the nose and lips, but was particularly convinced by a mole on the man's cheek. \"Such moles change little with age, though size may slightly differ,\" he said. \"Together with the similarity of ear characteristics, this mole, in a forensic case, would allow me to make a rare statement positively identifying Somerton man as H. C. Reynolds.\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/hc-reynolds.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">This image of a British seaman named H.C. Reynolds bears a strong resemblance to Somerton man</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst this may look convincing on the surface, there are problems. As with several other witnesses in the case, H.C. Reynolds' daughter has requested to remain anonymous and her claims have proven difficult to verify. Searches conducted by the US National Archives, the UK National Archives and the Australian War Memorial Research Centre have failed to find any records relating to H.C. Reynolds.</p><p>Other researchers have found possible civilian candidates named H.C. Reynolds, but the closest match died in 1953, not 1948.</p><p>Like so many leads in this case, this could prove to be yet another dead end, leaving us no closer to the solution to the mystery. All we really know is a man died; alone on a beach, unknown, unclaimed, perhaps unloved. </p><p>Maybe the most fitting epitaph to this story comes from the book at the center of the mystery, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam:</p>","tile":"mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case","path":"mystery-of-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case","date":"2019-11-03T19:18:27.650Z","formatteddate":"Nov 3, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Mystery of Somerton Man","subheadline":"The Taman <span>Shud Case</span>","snippet":"Was the unidentified man found dead on an Adelaide beach in 1948 a Cold War spy?","tags":["somerton man","taman shud","tamam","beach","poison","death","unsolved","unexplained","murder","mystery","espionage","cold","war","cold war","spy","spying","intelligence","soviet","ww2","australia"],"title":"Mystery of Somerton Man - The Taman Shud Case","tileheadline":"The Taman Shud Case"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/crystal-skull-at-the-british-museum.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Are the crystal skulls really ancient artifacts?</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was New Years Day 1924 when seventeen-year-old Anna Mitchell-Hedges first saw it.

What she found was incredible — an exquisite life-size human skull, crafted in pure quartz crystal.</p><p>Anna was mesmerized by her discovery. The skull seemed to have an unearthly power and aura. The girl’s father, renowned adventurer and explorer Frederick Mitchell-Hedges, was certain it was old, very old.</p><p>Mitchell-Hedges had spent the previous year excavating the great thousand-year-old ruined Mayan city at Lubaantun and thought the skull, which he labeled the ‘Skull of Doom’, a sinister ancient artifact used in religious rites.</p><p>“It is at least 3,600 years old and according to legend was used by the High Priest of the Maya when performing esoteric rites”, he wrote in his autobiography in 1954.</p><p>“It is said that when he willed death with the help of the skull, death invariably followed.

Principally through Anna’s tireless promotion, what was once an obscure curiosity would soon become one of the most famous strange objects in the world.</p><p>Supporters would even start to claim the skull had supernatural powers. Could it really read minds, heal the sick and predict the future? Was it, as some suggested, an ancient computer encoded with the wisdom of the lost civilization of Atlantis? Or even the work of aliens?</p><p>The legend of the skull was growing, fuelled by the enduring mystery of its origins. But despite Anna’s claims, a persistent group of skeptics had begun suspect the skull was a modern fake and Anna’s story a fabrication.</p><p>In 1970, in an attempt to dispel these doubts, Anna drafted in Hewlett-Packard to conduct tests on the skull. As one of the world’s leading experts in quartz crystal, the firm was best placed to determine just when and how the extraordinary object had been created.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/mayan-city-lubaantun.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The ruined Mayan city at Lubaantun</div></figcaption></figure><p>Their findings were a sensation.

Could it be she really was in possession of a mystical ancient artifact whose origins were lost in the mists of time?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>Science steps in</h3><p>In the 1960s, Anna Mitchell-Hedges entrusted the skull into the care of crystal expert Frank Dorland. Whilst quartz crystal itself cannot be dated, Dorland felt a microscopic study of the skulls workmanship might reveal more about its origins.</p><p>To that end, in 1970 Hewlett-Packard was called into to examine the skull. The computer and electronics giant had some of the world’s leading experts in quartz, as well as high-tech microscopes and x-ray equipment.</p><p>The firm’s analysis of the skull only seemed to deepen its mystery. According to their experts, the skull was made from a single piece of pure natural quartz and would have taken years to carve, even with the most advanced diamond tools.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/mitchell-hedges-skull.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Skull of Doom exhibited some amazing optical properties</div></figcaption></figure><p>But the firm felt it unlikely modern tools were used in its construction. Even under extreme magnification, they were unable to find any trace of machine tools. If it had been created using modern power tools, its maker had seemingly gone to great lengths to disguise it.</p><p>Furthermore, the skull appeared to have been carved against the quartz crystal’s natural grain, which they felt would have caused it to shatter if machined with powered tools.</p><p>Some of the skull’s other unusual electrical and optical properties also amazed the scientists at the firm’s Santa Clara labs.</p><p>The type of quartz used was piezoelectric silicon dioxide, today used widely in modern electronics. Indeed, the skull had positive and negative polarity and was capable of producing an electrical charge when under mechanical stress.</p><p>Even stranger was the skull’s optical properties. It was designed in such a way that light channeled from below would be focused out through the eye sockets. It also featured an internal prism that reflected the skulls surroundings inside of the crystal.</p><p>Hewlett Packard’s discovery of these unique qualities did much to cement the skull’s reputation as a deeply mysterious artifact.</p><p>Had the Mayans created it with some lost technology? Or had they merely inherited the artifact from a much earlier and more advanced civilization forgotten by history?</p><h3>Worship of the skull</h3><p>When Anna Mitchell-Hedges found the skull at Lubaantun, she says the Maya workers in the expedition immediately recognized it as a sacred artifact of their people.</p><p>Whilst no other crystal skulls have been found at any of the hundreds of well documented official Mayan or Aztec archeological sites, skulls were a recurring motif in ancient Mesoamerica, widely used in carvings and religious artworks.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/skulls-chichen-itza.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Skull iconography at Chichen Itza (credit: Paul Simon/Flickr)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Mayan god of death, Ah Puch, was depicted as a skull on a body of rotting flesh and several Aztec gods are also represented as skulls.</p><p>The walls of Chichen Itza, a 1500-year-old Mayan city located in present-day Yucatan, are decorated with rows of carved skulls, replete with sinister grins.

The late 60s and early 70s saw the birth of the New-age movement and the skull was seized upon as a possible relic of a distant lost civilization, even a repository of esoteric knowledge.</p><p>Several purported paranormal qualities have been attributed to the skull over the years. Anna Mitchell-Hedges herself once claimed it gave her a premonition of the death of President Kennedy in 1963. Others attribute mysterious deaths to the skull.</p><p>But the most common accounts are of visions and strange sounds. Frank Dorland, entrusted the skull by Anna in the late 60s, reported numerous odd experiences whilst in its presence.</p><p>He would see images of ancient temples in the skull’s eyes, Lubaantun at the height of the Mayan civilization. Alongside the visions he could hear metallic bells, singing, whispered voices and the sound of icy mountain streams.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/anna-mitchell-hedges-with-skull.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Anna Mitchell-Hedges with the Skull of Doom</div></figcaption></figure><p>Dorland, who started out as an engineer before becoming a noted art conservator, went on to write extensively about the powers of rock crystal. He believed the skull’s powers had a scientific explanation, something he called biocrystallography.</p><p>Dorland did not think the visions were paranormal phenomena, but a natural synchronicity between the crystal and the human brain — “the mass of crystal in some way triggered certain reflexes in the brain, to make you think that you were tasting things, hearing things or seeing things”, he said in 1988.</p><blockquote><span>\"the mass of crystal in some way triggered certain reflexes in the brain, to make you think that you were tasting things, hearing things or seeing things\"</span><br><cite>Frank Dorland</cite></blockquote><p>Could Dorland be right?

Could it be they were simply bamboozled by the skulls curious optical qualities?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Skullduggery</h3><p>Anna Mitchell-Hedges’ romantic account of finding the awesome Skull of Doom amongst the ruins of an ancient Mayan city when she was just a girl captured the imagination of millions of people around the world</p><p>However, a cursory study of her claims reveal a terrible truth. At best her story is heavily embellished, and in all likelihood it was entirely fictional.</p><p>Fredrick Mitchell-Hedges makes no mention of the skull until his 1954 autobiography ‘Danger My Ally’, where he declines to state its origins. Mitchell-Hedges was a self-publicist and notorious teller of tall tales, so for him to fail to mention this most extraordinary of finds is somewhat curious.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/danger-my-ally-by-frederick-albert-mitchell-hedges.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Mitchell-Hedges’ entertaining autobiography takes many liberties with the truth</div></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, no reference to the skull exists anywhere prior to a 1936 British anthropological journal, where it was reported to be not in Mitchell-Hedges’ possession at all, but that of an art dealer called Sydney Burney.</p><p>A note in the archives at the British museum states the skull was then put up for auction in 1943, failed to sell, but was eventually purchased in 1944 for the sum of £400. The buyer? Frederick Mitchell-Hedges.</p><p>Was the whole story of finding the skull in a ruined Mayan city twenty years earlier a fabrication?</p><p>None of the written accounts by those who took part in the Lubaantun expedition in the mid-1920s contains any reference to the presence of the teenage Anna or the discovery of the skull.</p><p>Indeed, Mitchell-Hedges himself, in his extensive writings and lecture tours following the dig also fails to mention Anna’s presence or the discovery of the skull. Likewise, a 1927 British Museum report on the dig also contains no reference to the skull or the presence of the teenaged Anna.</p><p>Whilst there are numerous photographs of Mitchell-Hedges, Thomas Gann, Lady Richmond Brown and other members of the expedition in and around the ruins of Lubaantun, not a single one features Anna or the skull.</p><p>The sad truth is Anna Mitchell-Hedges not only made up her incredible story about finding the skull in the ruins of Lubaantun, she was never there at all.</p><p>The genesis of her lie appears to begin not in the 1920s, but the 1960s, shortly after she came into possession of the skull and when she began to correspond with art restorer Frank Dorland.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/mitchell-hedges-expedition.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Anna Mitchell-Hedges is nowhere to be seen in any of the contemporary photos</div></figcaption></figure><p>It is in her letters to Dorland that the whole legend of the crystal skull is born.

After several further embellishments it eventually evolved into the one she would continue to tell for the rest of her life.</p><p>Why such an elaborate lie? One possibility is that Anna’s latter-day fiction about personally finding the skull was simply designed to re-enforce her ownership claims to the artifact in light of her subsequent attempts to sell it.</p><p>Another possibility is the abiding influence of Frederick Mitchell-Hedges himself. The archeologist was widely regarded as slapdash and reckless, and especially prone to gross exaggerations about his exploits. His writings are replete with absurd tales of Atlantis, giant sea creatures, and personally arm-wrestling gorillas.</p><p>Perhaps if nothing else, Anna, who Mitchell-Hedges adopted in 1919 when she was ten years old, was simply continuing her father’s habit of spinning outrageous yarns.</p><h3>The end is nigh</h3><p>Like so much in her life, Anna Mitchell-Hedges attributed her amazing longevity to the power of the skull. On this point at least, she may have had a point. Outliving many of her critics, Anna finally died in 2007 at the grand old age of 100.</p><p>Shortly before her death, she gifted the skull to her young husband Bill Homann. Like Anna, Homann would continue to firmly believe in the skull’s authenticity.</p><p>But within a year, the matter would be settled once and for all.</p><p>Jane MacLaren Walsh, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian, had taken an interest in crystal skulls after one was anonymously gifted to the museum in 1992. Walsh felt it doubtful they were genuine Mayan or Aztec artifacts as there was no record of either culture working crystal.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/paris-crystal-skull.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Paris crystal skull is a 19th-century fake</div></figcaption></figure><p>Although the Mitchell-Hedges is by far the most beautifully worked crystal skull in the world, it is not unique.

But had he acquired genuine ancient artifacts or faked them? The British museum and the Smithsonian teamed up to find out.</p><p>Like Hewlett-Packard in 1970, they were unable to date the actual quartz, but the team did have far more sophisticated tools at their disposal to determine how the skulls had been produced.</p><p>Using an electron microscope, X-ray crystallography, and CT scans, the results were definitive. Tell-tale tool marks showed the skulls had been produced using modern jewellers equipment, first available in the 19th century.</p><p>Trade in fake pre-Columbian artifacts was common at the time and it seems Boban had tried to cash in on the craze by commissioning the skulls, likely from artisans in Germany who specialized in working with quartz.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death/eugene-boban-crystal-skulls.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Eugene Boban was the source of many of the crystal skulls</div></figcaption></figure><p>But what of the Skull of Doom?

Whether this was brave or foolish is a matter of debate, but either way Homann did not like the answers.</p><p>Using the same advanced tests applied to the Paris and British museum skulls, Walsh was able to determine beyond any doubt that the legendary Mitchell-Hedges skull was also a modern fake, likely an improved copy of the London skull.</p><p>Science had finally solved one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century. But that wasn’t the end of the story for everyone.</p><p>Bill Homann’s faith, for one, remained intact. Homann reasoned that if the skull was made with modern tooling this was just evidence that the ancients had advanced technology unknown to history.</p><p>That’s the power of the Skull of Doom in a nutshell. Wherever it came from, however it was made, it’s ability to cast a spell on the beholder remains undiminished.</p><p>Other image credits — Mike Peel/wiki, Rafał Chałgasiewicz/wiki</p>","tile":"mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death","path":"mystery-of-the-crystal-skulls-the-stare-of-death","date":"2019-11-08T20:16:16.848Z","formatteddate":"Nov 8, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Mystery of the Crystal Skulls","subheadline":"The Stare <span>of Death</span>","snippet":"Are the mysterious crystal skulls ancient artifacts with mystical properties?","tags":["crystal","skull","skull of doom","Mitchell-Hedges","ancient","lost","civilization","Atlantis","paranormal","supernatural","mystery","Mayans","Aztecs","unsolved","weird","aliens"],"title":"Mystery of the Crystal Skulls - The Stare of Death","tileheadline":"The Stare of Death"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/odessa-the-nazi-ratline/odessa-nazi-ss.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Rumours that senior Nazis had escaped to South America emerged straight after the war</div></figcaption></figure><p>Odessa is a purported global network set up by high-ranking SS officers at the end of WW2.</p><p>The purpose of the clandestine organisation was to facilitate the escape of Nazi war criminals and their assets through ratlines to South America and the Middle East.</p><p>Odessa stands for the ‘Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen’, in English — ‘Organisation of Former SS Members’.</p><p>The name Odessa first cropped up in Western intelligence reports in the aftermath of the war, but today its status as a real group is hotly debated.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/odessa-the-nazi-ratline/simon-wiesenthal.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Simon Wiesenthal was certain Odessa existed</div></figcaption></figure><p>‘Nazi hunter’ Simon Wiesenthal was the first prominent figure to publicly endorse the existence of Odessa, and his work, along with other authors, inspired Frederick Forsythe to write his novel the ‘Odessa File’ in 1972.</p><p>Forsythe’s book, and the subsequent Hollywood film cemented the idea in the public mind that a sinister group of Nazis continued to plot after WW2 was lost.

In his book 'O.J. is Innocent and I Can Prove it', Dear cites Jason's history of violent outbursts as proof for his theory.</p><p>Dear says he found evidence Jason was diagnosed with IED - 'Intermittent Explosive Disorder’, a syndrome characterized by extreme outbursts of anger and rage over often trivial matters.</p><p>According to Dear, at the time of the murders Jason was on probation after being arrested for attacking a former employer with a knife. Two months earlier he violently assaulted Jennifer Green, his then girlfriend. On another occasion, he attacked a former girlfriend and sliced off her hair with a knife.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family/crime-scene-oj.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The grisly crime scene demonstrated a great deal of violence on the part of the killer</div></figcaption></figure><p>Dear also found what he says are Jason's personal diaries. They appear to reveal a man tormented by obsessive feelings of violence. One entry reads — \"It’s the year of the knife for me. I cut away my problems with a knife. Anybody touches my friends — I will kill them. I’m also tired of being Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\"</p><p>Jason apparently became so terrified by what he might do during these violent rages that on one occasion he checked himself into a mental hospital. In Dear's book he suggests Jason had been prescribed antipsychotic drugs for his IED but had stopped taking them shortly before the murders.</p><p>The murders of Nicole and Ron Goldman were particularly savage, Nicole Brown was stabbed multiple times in the head and neck, one cut so deep it almost decapitated her. Ron Goldman suffered dozens of stab wounds to his head, neck and body in a prolonged fight with the murderer.</p><p>Police described the brutal murders as 'rage killings'. Could Jason have attacked Nicole and Ron Goldman in a violent fit? He certainly had the means, a 'Jekyll and Hyde' personality and, as a chef, he was known to routinely carry knives about with him.</p><p>Dear claims Jason also had a motive; on the night of the murders Nicole was reportedly due to bring the family to Jason’s restaurant where he was going to cook for them, an event he was looking forward to. However, Nicole canceled the engagement at the last minute which greatly upset him.</p><p>As the sufferer of a mental illness that made him prone to exaggerate minor incidents, could this perceived slight have pushed Jason to murder?</p><h3>Jason’s alibi</h3><p>Jason was never considered a suspect by the police, who immediately fixated on his father. He wasn't even questioned and it was always thought he was working at Jackson’s restaurant in Beverly Hills at the time the murders occurred.</p><p>But Dear found Jason’s time card for that night and discovered an odd irregularity. Where all the other entries were printed, the time Jason clocked off on the night of the murders had been written in afterwards by hand.</p><p>Dear also interviewed workers at the restaurant and discovered Jason had actually closed the kitchen early that night because business was slow.</p><p>If Dear’s claims are correct, Jason not only lied about his alibi but his whereabouts at the time of the murders are unknown.</p><h3>OJ’s lack of injuries</h3><p>The murder of Ron Goldman followed a prolonged struggle with his attacker. Goldman, a strongly built man more than 20 years OJ’s junior was a karate black belt and there was evidence he put up a fierce defence of his life.</p><p>Goldman's body and fists were covered in dozens of bruises, scratches and cuts, even his shoes had cuts on them, indicating he had kicked his murderer. His battered knuckles showed he had repeatedly made contact not just with the assailant’s flesh but his bones.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family/bloody-glove-oj.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The bloody glove and knit cap left at the crime scene by the murderer</div></figcaption></figure><p>Forensic pathologist Michael Baden estimated Goldman may have struggled with his attacker for up to 15 minutes. Yet when OJ’s body was examined and photographed by the police the next day, aside from a small cut on his finger, he was entirely free of any mark or injury.</p><p>Even this cut did not appear to be evident when OJ stopped to sign autographs on his way to catch a plane just an hour or so after the murders were supposed to have occurred. This cut, much trumpeted by the prosecution, also did not match any corresponding cut in the bloody glove the attacker was thought to have worn.</p><p>How could OJ have brutally murdered two people with a knife and been in such a prolonged violent struggle with Goldman and not have sustained any injuries?</p><h3>Forensic evidence</h3><p>Whilst much of the convincing forensic evidence against Simpson was undermined by allegations of sloppy handling and tampering, some evidence also exists that point to his innocence.</p><p>Blood and skin found under Nicole’s fingernails, as well as blood splatter on her back, matched neither her, Ron Goldman or OJ Simpson and are unidentified to this day. Jason was never interviewed by the police and never gave a DNA sample, was the blood his?</p><p>The navy blue knit cap found at the scene matched a knit cap Jason was known to wear before the murders. Hair from an Afro-American male, as well as dog hairs, were found in the cap. One picture showing Jason wearing an identical cap has him reclined on his bed with his dog.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family/jason-simpson-knitcap.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jason wearing a knit cap similar to the one found at the crime scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>No knife matching the murder weapon was ever found amongst OJ’s belongings. However, a knife found amongst Jason’s belongings is consistent with the wound thought to have been inflicted with the butt of a knife on Nicole’s head.</p><p>All of the forensic pathologists who testified at the trial agreed the murderer must have been covered in blood after such a violent attack, yet only a small drop of it was found in the white Bronco Simpson was alleged to have fled the scene in.</p><p>The accused was then said to have rushed back to his home to clean up, yet the white carpet that covered the ground floor of Simpson’s Brentwood house was inexplicably free of any trace of blood.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>The Bronco chase</h3><p>When it became apparent Simpson was going to be arrested for the murders he left what appeared to be a suicide note with the media and took off in his white Ford Bronco.</p><p>Driven by his old friend Al Cowlings, OJ was on the back seat of the vehicle with a gun up to his head. In bizarre scenes broadcast live on TV, the Bronco could be seen in a slow speed chased followed by 20 police cars.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family/oj-simpsons-bronco-chase.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The bizarre slow-speed Bronco chase was seen as an admission of guilt to many</div></figcaption></figure><p>After more than an hour of pleading Simpson was finally persuaded to put the gun down and he handed himself in to the authorities.</p><p>In the Bronco the police found $8,000 in cash, a change of clothing, a loaded .357 Magnum, a passport, family pictures, and a fake goatee and moustache.</p><p>Simpson’s extraordinary behaviour was clearly indicative of some kind of guilt and many took it almost as a confession.

Or did he realise he was going to take the rap for his son Jason and panic?</p><h3>The footprints</h3><p>Bloody footprints found at the scene matched OJ’s rare size 12 Bruno Magli shoes.

Or was his presence there an attempt to cover up for Jason?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family/simpson-shoes.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Simpson pictured at a football game wearing the Bruno Magli shoes linked to the murder scene</div></figcaption></figure><h3>Witnesses</h3><p>Multiple witnesses report seeing Simpson near the vicinity of the crime scene around the time of the murders, but none reported seeing Jason.</p><p>Local resident Jill Shively nearly collided with OJ’s speeding Bronco when it ran a red light close to the murder scene just minutes after the attacks were thought to have occurred.</p><p>“O.J. was inches away from me,” she said. “His eyes were like a madman’s. He waved his arms and screamed: ‘Move! Get out of my way!’”</p><p>Nicole’s neighbour Robert Heidstra also testified seeing a white vehicle similar to Simpson’s Bronco rapidly leaving the murder scene.</p><p>These witnesses look bad for OJ. But they are not evidence that he killed Brown and Goldman, only that he may have been present at the crime scene.</p><h3>Jason’s lack of injuries</h3><p>Unlike OJ, Jason was never examined and photographed by police doctors. But that aside, he can be seen in TV reports amongst the police, family and employees circulating around Simpson’s Rockingham home in the aftermath of the crime.</p><p>There has never been any suggestion, not even anecdote or rumour, that Jason showed any sign of injury during this time. If he had just violently murdered two people, involving the aforementioned fight with Ron Goldman, he would surely have had visible cuts and bruises that would have aroused the suspicion of those around him.</p><p>@block-ads</p>","tile":"oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family","path":"oj-simpson-a-killer-in-the-family","date":"2019-11-03T11:22:20.932Z","formatteddate":"Nov 3, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"OJ Simpson","subheadline":"A Killer in <span>the Family</span>","snippet":"Was OJ Simpson’s son Jason the true killer of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown?","tags":["OJ","Simpson","Jason","son","crime","murder","trial","police","LAPD","corruption","Nicole Brown","Ron Goldman","Bill Dear","unsolved","mystery","conspiracy","celebrity","Hollywood"],"title":"OJ Simpson - A Killer in the Family","tileheadline":"A Killer in the Family"},{"body":"<p>-oj-trial-gloves.jpg</p><p>Everybody knows OJ Simpson killed Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.

Police detective Mark Fuhrman, pivotal in collecting key evidence against Simpson, was a self avowed genocidal racist who carried a swastika with him and boasted about planting evidence.</p><p>The LA police themselves were embroiled in a whole series of ethics scandals, from the beating of Rodney King to the Ramparts corruption scandal.

It actually came from a whistleblower within the LAPD itself.</p><p>A journalist by the name of Stephen Singular was first approached about the OJ Simpson case just a few weeks after the murders. Singular, who had previously written a book about the murder of jewish talk radio host Alan Berg by a neo-Nazi group called The Order, was contacted by an anonymous source within the LA police with a disturbing story.</p><p>According to the author's own Deep Throat, a faction of extreme racist neo-Nazi police officers was operating within the LAPD. More troubling still, some of them had planted evidence in the OJ Simpson case.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/mark-fuhrman-oj-simpson-trial-1995.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman was exposed at the trial as a racist</div></figcaption></figure><p>Months before the trial and subsequent media storm about racism and evidence tampering, Singular was given some very specific information. Firstly, an LA police detective by the name of Mark Fuhrman openly espoused extreme racist views, boasted about persecuting interracial couples and even painted a swastika on the locker of a colleague who had married a jewish woman.</p><p>On the night of the murders Fuhrman was one of the first police officers at Nicole’s Bundy Drive home. According to Singular’s source, the detective had used a piece of strict broken off the fence to pick up a bloody glove at the crime scene and place it in a blue evidence bag.</p><p>Fuhrman and another detective then made an undocumented trip to OJ Simpson's house at Rockingham in the early hours of the next morning and dropped the glove behind a fence to the side of the property. It was Fuhrman himself who then subsequently found this apparently piece of damning evidence against Simpson.</p><p>Singular was also told that a vial of OJ’s blood was in the possession of another LA police detective for several hours whilst he had free reign of the crime scene. This blood sample, which Simpson volunteered to police the day after the murders, was stored in an evidence vial with a purple cap, which indicated the presence of an anti-coagulant chemical called EDTA.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/oj-simpson-gives-blood.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">OJ Simpson volunteered a blood sample to the police</div></figcaption></figure><p>Blood from this vial was then deposited at the crime scene and the bloody socks found in Simpson’s bedroom to frame him. It sounded unbelievable, and Singular was not sure at the time what to make of the sensational information.</p><p>Subsequently, almost everything Singular was first told would be validated by what unfolded in the coming months. A stick and a blue evidence bag were found on Simpson’s property and entered into evidence, Fuhrman was outed as a genocidal racist and some of the key testimony about his actions that night were shown to be false.</p><p>The famous photograph of him pointing at the bloody glove was actually shown to be taken at 4:30am, rather than 7am as Fuhrman and his fellow officers stated. That Fuhrman had made undocumented visits to the Rockingham house during the night was further bolstered by Rosa Lopez, a maid at the house next door, who told Fuhrman himself she had heard two men arguing at the property at 2am. Tellingly, Fuhrman failed to include this information in his report.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/bundy-bloody-glove.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Singular was told that Fuhrman had moved the bloody glove and planted it at Simpson’s home</div></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps most importantly, Singular’s information about the blood checked out. Several pieces of the most important Simpson blood evidence was found to contain EDTA, strongly indicative that that blood was planted from an evidence vial, and did not come out of a human being during the execution of the crime.</p><p>This blood evidence is still hotly disputed, and the prosecution spent a great deal of time at the trial trying to show the EDTA found in the crime scene blood was due to mistakes in the testing. But if that was truly the case, how could Stephen Singular's source possibly have known EDTA would be mistakenly found in the blood months in advance?</p><h3>Walking between the raindrops</h3><p>During the 1995 criminal trial, much was made of the incompetent way the LAPD handled the forensic evidence in the case. Countless examples of crucial exhibits been compromised because they were not collected or documented properly were argued about in the courtroom.</p><p>Added to the credible testimony that key blood evidence was tampered with and the jury were left with the impression that the forensics in the case against Simpson simply could not be trusted.</p><p>This aspect of the case is well worn and much debated. The mainstream advocates of OJ Simpson’s guilt dismiss the doubts as insufficient to overturn what they see as the overwhelming weight of the case against their suspect.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/ron-goldman-knuckles.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Ron Goldman had a violent fight with his killer</div></figcaption></figure><p>But beyond what is often a circular argument, there are a number of inexplicable contradictions in the evidence that are far less well known, but that are very difficult to reconcile with Simpson’s guilt.</p><p>Both sides agree that at the time of the murders OJ Simpson was a middle aged man who was not in the best condition. He had bad knees and was on medication for two different forms of arthritis. He was suffering the effects the toll of his NFL playing says had taken on his body.</p><p>In order to get around the unlikely proposition that OJ could have simultaneously murdered two younger fitter adults without either calling for help, escaping or seriously injuring him in the process, the prosecution contended that Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman separately.</p><p>Testimony from Detective Tom Lange casts serious doubt on this. Lange was one of the first police officers at the scene, and explained during the trial how the gate mechanism that granted access to Nicole's house did not work properly. The intercom functioned but the buzzer to open the gate did not, meaning Nicole had to come out of the house and open the gate manually to let people in.</p><p>If Nicole had granted OJ access to the property at an earlier time, and then he had murdered her, it would mean he would have had to have let Ron Goldman into the property either during or shortly after he had killed Nicole, a prospect so absurd as to be discounted.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/simpson-body-police-photos.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">OJ Simpson had no injuries to his body when he was examined by police less than a day after the murders</div></figcaption></figure><p>It seems more likely that it was Nicole that opened the gate for Ron Goldman, meaning the pair were both at the property when the murders commenced. This returns us to the original problem; how could Simpson have overpowered and brutally murdered two adults simultaneously without either calling for help and without sustaining any serious injuries himself?</p><p>The day after the murders, OJ was stripped to his underwear by the police and photographed. His body did not contain any signs of injury or bruising, aside from the infamous small cut to his finger.</p><p>This cut was much trumpeted by the prosecution, but since there was no corresponding hole in the bloody glove, they had to concoct a speculative scenario which had Goldman pulling the stiff, tight fitting leather glove off whilst been stabbed to death.</p><p>Both Goldman and Nicole clearly struggled with their killer, Ron’s body was covered in defense wounds, his knuckles were battered and even the soles of his shoes had knife cuts on them were Goldman had kicked his assailant.</p><p>It is barely conceivable that Simpson on his own could have murdered them separately and not sustained major injuries, so the notion that he did so simultaneously seems impossible. Could there have been more than one killer?</p><p>Evidence for multiple killers is clearly contained in Dr Irwin Golden’s autopsy report. Golden was the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsies on the victims, and concluded two different types of knife were used, a single bladed knife and a more serrated double bladed dagger like weapon.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/oj-simpson-cut-finger.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Simpson said this cut was made in his hotel room after the murders had occured</div></figcaption></figure><p>Golden’s findings were highly contentious, and due to legal manoeuvrings by both sides at the trial he did not testify to his findings. Instead his boss was called to testify on his behalf, and he was far more equivocal about the possibility of multiple killers, admitting only that it was conceivable although he did not think it was the case.</p><p>Despite this, Golden’s original findings that there were two killers are a better fit for the facts than the idea that a first time killer such as Simpson could have so cleanly dispatched two victims with a knife without himself sustaining any serious injuries.</p><p>The two killer theory was also bolstered by still unidentified DNA and fingerprints found at the crime scene, untested blood spatter on Nicole’s back and what appeared to be two different sets of bloody footprints on the pathway.</p><p>For most people, especially those who have consumed the mainstream material on the subject, one the most persuasive reasons to believe in Simpson’s guilt are the now infamous Bruno Magli shoes.</p><p>Footprints from the distinctive and rare shoes were found in the victim's blood at the crime scene and whilst Simpson initially denied owning a pair of the shoes, his guilt in the matter only seemed to be compounded by photographs that emerged of him from before the murders wearing a pair of the same shoes.</p><p>The Bruno Magli’s are now routinely trotted out as a kind of definitive clincher in the case against Simpson, but a more thorough look at the real evidence reveal it to be somewhat less convincing.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/bloody-footprints-bundy.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Footprints in blood were found at the crime scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>As author TH Johnson discovered, the actual uniqueness of the shoes is overstated. Whilst the shoe upper itself was very rare, perhaps as little as 200 pairs of their kind in the United States, the soles of the shoes were far more common. Johnson tracked down the manufacturer and found that they had sold the same sole designs to dozens of other shoe producers, meaning they could have been attached to many thousands of pairs of shoes.</p><p>Johnson also found that the size of the shoe sole in question was smaller than a tracing of Simpson’s feet he obtained from prison; if OJ could have gotten them on his feet at all they would have been tight-fitting and uncomfortable.</p><p>The prosecution scenario involving the shoes was always unconvincing. Why would Simpson chose to change out of the sneakers he had been wearing earlier in the evening into a pair of expensive and traceable shoes to go and commit a murder? Especially a pair of shoes that quite clearly must have been extremely uncomfortable for him to wear.</p><p>We would also have to accept that Simpson so expertly disposed of nearly all of the evidence against him, his bloody clothes, the murder weapon, and the shoes that not a trace of it has ever been found, yet foolishly left a pair of bloody socks in the middle of his bedroom floor.</p><p>Like much of the other blood evidence, the blood on the socks was not discovered until several weeks after they were entered into evidence. At the trial, Herbert Macdonell, a blood splatter expert, testified that the pattern of the stains on both sides of the sock indicated the blood had been pressed onto them when they were laying flat, a sure sign that the blood had been planted.</p><p>The prosecution naturally tried to counteract this claim, but other logical gaps in the blood evidence just wouldn't go away. If, for instance, Simpson really was the person wearing the shoes that made the bloody footprints at the murder scene, how did he then make his escape in the white Ford Bronco without leaving blood on the pedals of the car?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/philip-vannatter.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Detective Vannatter had a vial of Simpson’s blood at the crime scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>The paucity of blood in the Bronco was just one in a collection of similarly puzzling anomalies. Only a few drops in total were ever found in the vehicle, a near impossibility considering Simpson had to be covered in blood after the violent and prolonged knife murder of two adults just seconds earlier.</p><p>Detectives Fuhrman, Vannatter and Lange also gave conflicting testimonies on when they first observed blood in Simpson's Bronco. Despite how small they were, Fuhrman would claim he saw the spots of blood in the dark by looking through the vehicle's windows with a small flashlight.</p><p>However at the trial, officers unconnected to the investigation testified that they did not observe any blood whilst internally inspecting the vehicle in broad daylight at the police garage. Startlingly, the vehicle was also broken into twice whilst impounded by the police, casting further suspicion on the provenance of the blood evidence inside.</p><h3>A question of time</h3><p>OJ Simpson built his formidable reputation in the NFL by been one of the fastest running backs around. Indeed he is one of the few footballers to hold a world record in athletics, his 1967 USC track team still holding the rarely run 440 yard relay record.</p><p>If the prosecution theory of the murders is correct, he translated all of that brevity to the night of June 12 1994. The now widely accepted timeline that has OJ Simpson committing the murders at Bundy Drive and returning to his Rockingham home entails Simpson doing an improbable number of things in an equally improbable short period of time.</p><p>At the trial the defense and prosecution disagreed at what times the murders actually occurred. The state's lawyers used the testimony of local resident Pablo Fenjves, who said that he had heard Nicole Brown’s dog barking at around 10:15-10:20, to assert this was when a violent disturbance began at the property.</p><p>However a recently uncovered crime scene photograph of Nicole's watch appears to show it had broken during the attack and was stuck at 9:59. If that is the case it would probably exonerate Simpson, who was known to still be at home shortly before this, and also made a cell phone call to girlfriend Paula Barbieri at 10:03.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/nicole-brown-crime-scene-watch.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A rarely scene crime photo seems to show Nicole’s watch had stopped at 9:59pm</div></figcaption></figure><p>It is ambiguous as to whether this photo shows the time at 9:59 on the night of the murders or 9:59 the following morning when the photos may have been taken. The watch was broken when it was returned to the family, but when this occurred is unclear, leaving this piece of evidence a tantalising mystery,</p><p>Another ear witness is neighbour Denise Pilnak, whose telephone records provide a cast iron timestamp to her testimony. Pilnak recalls immediately before she phoned her sister at 10:25 she had been stood on her porch for a while and was struck by how quiet the neighbourhood sounded.</p><p>The phone records indicate the call to Pilnak’s sister ended at 10:28, and by her estimation it was not until around 5-10 minutes after this that she heard the protracted sound of dog barking emitting from Nicole Brown’s home. This is clearly the same barking Pablo Fenjves heard and it did not begin until sometime after 10:30pm.</p><p>A neatly dressed, normal looking OJ Simpson greeted his limousine driver Allan Park outside of his Rockingham home at 11:00pm. This timing is not disputed as it is timestamped by a cell phone call Park made five minutes prior to this, and also Simpson’s 11:33pm check in time at LAX airport.</p><p>If the prosecution's theory that OJ Simpson committed the murders is correct, and the dogs barking coincided with the attack, then the number of things Simpson would have had to have done in less than 20 minutes is quite startling.</p><p>First he would have had to separately murder two grown adults in prolonged, extremely violent knife attacks. The attack on Ron Goldman alone may have taken up to 10 minutes based on the sheer number of defense wounds he suffered. Simpson then had to get in his Bronco and drive back to his property, a 5-10 minute drive depending on conditions.</p><p>Advocates of OJ’s guilt often cite the testimony of Jill Shively, who claimed to have seen Simpson in his Bronco making this return journey at 10:50pm. The defense team discredited Shively before the trial and she did not testify, but five minutes after her supposed sighting, at 10:55pm, limo driver Allan Park saw a large, dark figure resembling Simpson enter the house at Rockingham.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/rockingham-house-oj-simpson.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">OJ Simpson’s home at Rockingham</div></figcaption></figure><p>If these sightings were Simpson, it meant he had to shower or clean the blood off his hands and body, dispose of any towels or tissues he used, clean the basin or shower, stem the putative deep cut on his finger, dispose of the murder weapon, his shoes and the bloody clothes, none of which were ever found, and dress and compose himself in five minutes or less.</p><p>The next few hours of Simpson's time are very well documented. During the drive to LAX airport he has the limo window wound down and makes small talk with Park, who describes Simpson as relaxed and chatty.</p><p>On the plane to Chicago, Simpson is described by witnesses as appearing normal and approachable. Simpson signs several autographs during this time, and even talks with the pilot and signs his flight log. None of these witnesses recall any kind of visible injuries to Simpson, despite several of them getting a look at his hands.</p><p>Student Stephen Valerie, sat next to OJ on the plane, even testified at the trial as to how he looked closely at Simpson's fingers to see if he could spot his NFL championship ring, but observed no cuts or injuries.</p><p>This official timeline of OJ’s actions after the murders, whilst not impossible, looks implausibly tight. But a more fundamental problem emerges in the form of a phone call Nicole Brown made to her mother on the night of the murders, a phone call which might very well prove OJ Simpson is innocent.</p><p>Shortly after the murders, Nicole's parents Juditha and Louis Brown told investigators that Juditha had briefly talked with Nicole on the phone at 11:00pm. Earlier that evening they had dined with Nicole, her sisters and her children at LA’s Mezzaluna restaurant, before they departed for home at 8:45pm.</p><p>The senior Browns lived at Dana point in Orange County, ordinarily a 90 minute drive from the Mezzaluna, although author TH Johnson obtained highways data for the night that showed a combination of congestion and road works had reduced traffic speed to less than 30 mph for several stretches of the journey.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/mezzaluna-monarch-beach.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Brown’s drive home would have taken at least 90 minutes on the night of the 12th</div></figcaption></figure><p>Allowing some extra time for this still makes the 11pm call feasible within the timeline of the Brown’s movements. However once it became apparent that the 11:00pm call exonerated Simpson, who was known to be departing for the airport at the time, the time of the call had to be revised.</p><p>The prosecution eventually concluded the call took place at 9:40pm, as this better fitted their scenario that OJ Simpson had committed the murders. But it clearly contradicted the movements of the Browns, as it entailed them making a minimum 90 minute journey in less than an hour, an impossibility particularly in light of the traffic conditions.</p><p>This puzzling aspect of the case is unexplained to this day. Although the prosecution entered a pasteboard featuring what was purported to be a cropped photograph of Juditha Brown’s phone bill showing the 9:40pm call, the actual verified phone records remain unreleased.</p><p>The fact a piece of evidence so pivotal that it could definitively prove OJ Simpson did not commit the murders is still unavailable for scrutiny more than 20 years after the crimes is troubling to say the least.</p><h3>Cocaine and Blue Eyes</h3><p>Whatever really happened that night at Bundy drive one dark and unsettling question has not only remained unanswered, but also largely unasked - was there a drugs connection to the murders?</p><p>Johnnie Cochran briefly broached a drugs angle at the trial when he asked about Nicole's neck would resembling the Colombian necktie, a form of killing favoured by drugs gangs that involves slitting the throat from ear to ear.</p><p>Aside from this, both sides retreated from any connections the drugs underworld may have had in the crime and the subject was not mentioned again. However, from a look at the various key players involved, and both OJ and victims’ social circles, it’s quite clear that the environment in which the crimes committed was steeped in drugs.</p><p>Perhaps it is the sheer scope and breadth of the drugs connections that made both sides reluctant to touch the subject; many unifying truths could be uncovered by delving too deep into that world.  But with the murders occurring in a time and a place that was an epicentre of drugs related violence it would clearly be foolish to dismiss the avenue of investigation altogether.</p><p>It was well known in Hollywood circles that OJ Simpson and Nicole Brown were heavy cocaine users. But it appears for both of them their involvement in drugs had progressed beyond the kind of casual use you would except in the world they lived in.</p><p>Nicole, according to friends, was just days from entering rehab at the time of her death. Like her friend Faye Resnick, it appeared her drug use was becoming reckless and dangerous. On one occasion the pair even freebased coke whilst driving through LA.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/mezzaluna-brentwood.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Mezzaluna resteraunt</div></figcaption></figure><p>OJ himself had been suspected or caught actually dealing drugs both before and after the murders. In 1975 he was the target of an FBI sting when he was suspected of dealing coke to NFL players. Simpson’s friend and confident Al Cowlings, who was in the White Bronco with OJ during the famous slow speed chase down a south LA highway, also used to work for Mafia drug kingpin Joey Ippolito.</p><p>Caught up in that 1975 drug sting was an associate of OJ's named Casimir Sucharski, who would later become one of a string of people to be brutally murdered around the same time as Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.</p><p>Just three weeks after the murders at Bundy Drive, Sucharski and two others were slaughtered in Sucharski’s Florida home in what looked some kind of drug burn or hit. Whilst the connection to what happened at Bundy may be tenuous, what of the Ron Goldman’s friends Brett Cantor and Michael Nigg?</p><p>Cantor, a local nightclub entrepreneur, was a mutual friend of both Ron and Nicole. He was brutally stabbed to death a year before Goldman was also stabbed to death in remarkably similar fashion.</p><p>A year after Goldman's death another friend of his, fellow Mezzaluna employee Michael Nigg, was gunned down at a cashpoint in LA. Nothing was taken and it appeared the motive was not robbery.</p><p>That four middle class white people from the same social circle, all from solid family backgrounds, would be brutally murdered gangland style in a relatively short two year period seems suspicious, equally so since none of the murders have ever been solved. Could there be a connection?</p><p>There has been speculation that perhaps some kind of small scale drugs ring may have been operating out of the Mezzaluna, and its participants may have gotten in over their heads with the bigger operators in the LA drugs underworld. As fanciful as it may seem, there is some evidence to support it.</p><p>Because most people are so adamant that OJ Simpson is guilty, it is inevitable that Ron Goldman often gets overlooked as a possible target of the attacks in his own right. But as author TH Johnson discovered, local residents had reported to a nearby tennis club that Goldman had been selling drugs in the area, could he have encroached on the territory of some bigger players?</p><p>It is rarely reported that at the time of his death Ron Goldman had an extensive criminal file, including outstanding arrest warrants. Johnson tried to obtain this file during the course of his research but discovered it had been classified under a Californian law designed to protect confidential informants.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/marvin-glass-oj-simpson.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Mobster Marvin Glass was in LA the night of the murders</div></figcaption></figure><p>Who or what had Goldman been informing on? One possibility is Goldman’s convoluted family background. His father Fred Goldman had married a woman named Patti Glass, the ex-wife of a Mafia lawyer and drugs dealer named Marvin Glass.</p><p>Goldman had married Patti Glass shortly after Marvin was jailed for his part in a huge drugs money laundering operation, and took custody of three of Glass’ children. According to one of the sons who became part of this makeshift new Goldman family, Fred was cruel and abusive to them.</p><p>Was Ron feeding the authorities information about Marvin Glass? Or was Glass, released and in LA on the night of the murders, directly involved in them? According to Glass’ son Brian, his father had developed a deep resentment to Fred Goldman about the perceived mistreatment of his sons whilst he was in prison.</p><p>Glass was by the court’s own account a psychotic individual, who by 1994 was dying of AIDS obtained during a blood transfusion. Did he arrange to wreak the ultimate revenge by depriving Fred of his own son Ron?</p><p>Simpson himself now apparently promotes the drug theory, at least according to Jeffrey Felix, a prison guard who says he befriended Simpson following his incarceration for armed robbery in 2007. Felix says OJ told him drug dealers had murdered Nicole and Ron over unpaid debts.</p><p>If there was anything to this, it is not surprising it was never pursued. The murky nexus of Hollywood, drugs and organised crime has always been Los Angeles’ darkest secret. The tentacles of illegal narcotics dealing spread deep into every aspect of power in the city and as would be uncovered in the years after the trial this very much included the LAPD.</p><p>The Ramparts scandal that blew in the late 90s led to the biggest corruption investigation in American law enforcement history. By the end of it dozens of LAPD officers were implicated in various cases of misconduct, many of them involving the theft and dealing of narcotics.</p><p>Valid leads that pointed to drugs as a motive for the crime may well have been overlooked by all concerned, precisely because it risked airing too much dirty laundry, whether relevant to the case and not.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>An unlucky man</h3><p>Whilst convincing arguments can be made against some of the key cornerstones for the case against OJ Simpson, equally convincing arguments can be made that there simply should not be such a weight of circumstantial evidence against him if he is innocent.</p><p>Even if we account for the possibility that the LAPD fabricated some of the evidence, OJ Simpson would still have to be as unlucky as the hapless Officer Norberg he portrayed in the Naked Gun films for the number of other incriminating things that point at his guilt on the night of the murder to have occurred purely by chance.</p><p>He is unlucky that he did not have a more convincing alibi on the night of the murders. If Simpson had been on the telephone or in the company of other people when the murders happened he could have been eliminated as a suspect early in the investigation.</p><p>He is unlucky that a woman named Jill Shively, who claims she saw Simpson frantically fleeing the crime scene in his white Bronco, managed to almost correctly guess or imagine his cars number plate - Shively said 3ZWZ788, it was actually 3CWZ788.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/bronco-blood-evidence.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The blood found in Simpson’s Bronco</div></figcaption></figure><p>Although the Bruno Magli shoes were not as unique as the prosecution alleged, Simpson was still exceptionally unlucky that the real killer wore shoes extremely similar to his, and left incriminating footprints that made it appear as though Simpson was at the crime scene.</p><p>Perhaps OJ Simpson's worst piece of luck was accidentally cutting his finger. The deep cut on the knuckle of one of the finger’s on his left hand was, according to Simpson, inflicted when he smashed a glass in his Chicago hotel room. When detectives saw the cut the next day they were naturally suspicious that it’s existence was more than a coincidence.</p><p>Simpson’s poor luck has continued in the decades following the trial. Despite this been perhaps the most high profile murder case of the 20th century, with almost every angle of the case subject to endless scrutiny, very little truly credible evidence pointing to anyone other than OJ as the culprit has ever emerged,</p><p>If someone in the drugs or gangs underworld was responsible, then others would know about it, and people would have talked. The sheer amount of money to be made out of anything pertaining to this most infamous case would guarantee that. It is perhaps OJ's greatest misfortune that nobody has.</p><h3>Covering the cover-up</h3><p>It is unarguable in light of the LAPD's woeful conduct in the 1990s that they at least had the proclivity to fabricate and plant evidence against suspects. However in the specific circumstances of the OJ Simpson investigation, many critics argue that evidence tampering simply would not of been a viable option for the police officers involved.</p><p>The problem lies with what the detectives involved could have known on the night of the murders. If Mark Fuhrman really did pick up a bloody glove from the crime scene and plant it at OJ Simpson’s house, he would either have to be extremely stupid or be absolutely sure Simpson was really guilty.</p><p>In the early hours of June 13 1994, as dozens of officers swarmed around both Nicole’s condo on Bundy Drive and Simpson's home at Rockingham, none of them could conceivably have known what had really happened or who was responsible. To plant evidence pointing so clearly at OJ Simpson would have been foolhardy unless they were already certain OJ Simpson did not have an alibi.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/bundy-crime-scene.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The crime scene at Bundy Drive</div></figcaption></figure><p>But It is not clear how Fuhrman, or anyone else on the force, could have known this one way or another. By the time they had arrived at scene, Simpson was out of town and his exact whereabouts at the time of the murders were unknown.</p><p>If Fuhrman has planted the bloody glove, or Philip Vannatter the incriminating blood, and it subsequently emerged that Simpson had a cast iron alibi, then it would be quite clear that he was been framed for the crime, and the detectives involved would be prime suspects.</p><p>Equally, if something later emerged that definitively pointed to somebody else as the culprit, a confession or some damning forensic or circumstantial evidence, then the LAPD's conspiracy to frame Simpson would surely be uncovered.</p><p>It is the sheer extent of the blood evidence, both at Bundy and Rockingham, in the Bronco and on the socks, that make the prospect of tampering seem unlikely. It points to an omnipotence over the crime scene that nobody in the LAPD could realistically have had, at least not unless the conspiracy to frame Simpson was far larger than anybody has conceived.</p><h3>A guilty mind</h3><p>OJ Simpson’s often bizarre behaviour in the aftermath of the crime has convinced many of his guilt. Some of his actions not only betray a guilty mind and lack of conscience, but seem tantamount to a confession.</p><p>In 2006, 1994 crime scene witness Pablo Fenjves ghost wrote a book with OJ Simpson named If I Did It. This notorious book, based on several interviews between the men, describes a purported hypothetical scenario were Simpson killed Nicole with an accomplice he would only name as Charlie.</p><p>If we are to take this book seriously, and it would be extraordinarily callous of Simpson to write such a book if he was innocent, then we also have to seriously consider what he actually says about the involvement of a second person in the murders.

According to the author, Simpson would talk very coldly about the murders, often articulating what were supposed to be imaginary details as if they were fact.

As with much in this case its is difficult to sift through fact and fiction, and absent a straightforward written or televised confession from Simpson himself, it is perhaps unwise to take any words supposedly written by him at face value.</p><p>Simpson’s life seemed to spiralling out of control, and as his world and reputation crumbled around him, he would become embroiled in a whole series of increasingly oddball misdemeanours, alleged assaults and drugs busts; he even sank as low as to release a sex tape in 2001.</p><p>In 2007, effectively excluded from mainstream society, Simpson took part in an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas, a desperate attempt to reclaim back sports memorabilia he believed belonged to him.</p><p>The unusually harsh sentence of 33 years he received for his part in the robbery was seen by many as an attempt to readdress the balance of the contentious acquittal back in 1995. Simpson finally ended up in jail, just not for the crime almost everyone believes he committed.</p><p>Whatever really happened that night in 1994, only one version of the truth is now allowed any serious consideration in the mainstream media. It is the truth established by the Goldman family’s successful civil prosecution of Simpson in 1997.

First as one quarter of the greatest pop band in history - the Beatles, then for a successful 40 year solo career featuring a string of hit singles and albums.</p><p>The Beatles’ expansive music and surreal lyrics had always inspired theories and speculation amongst their fans, but by the height of their fame in the late 60s a weird rumour was beginning to move from college campuses to the mainstream media; the band's bassist and joint songwriter Paul McCartney was dead.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-mccartney-1964.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul in 1964, before the supposed fatal accident</div></figcaption></figure><p>This came as news to McCartney himself, who in 1969, when the stories of his death reached fever pitch, appeared to be walking around alive and well.

Apparently not, as far as the conspiracy went.</p><p>The central tenet of the Paul is Dead theory was that sometime in late 1966, McCartney was killed in a tragic car accident. Determined not to end the most profitable and successful band in history, the management drafted in a look-alike to masquerade as the deceased Beatle and keep the moneymaking juggernaut intact. </p><p>As weird as it may have sounded, proponents of the theory managed to find dozens of inexplicable references in the Beatles’ songs and album covers following Paul’s supposed demise that appeared to be hinting that something really had happened to the bassist.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/the-beatles-1964-america.jpg?-i4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Beatles stormed America in early 1964</div></figcaption></figure><p>Was Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band a coded confession of the truth?

And why, if you played the White Album’s track Revolution 9 backwards could you hear the words ‘turn me on dead man?’</p><p>Whilst some of the musical analysis looks fanciful, according to believers the photographic evidence clinches their case. The McCartney of the late 60s they argue, of Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road fame, is clearly not the same man of the early and mid 60s, the era of Please Please Me and Help!</p><p>Paul certainly does appear to look different in some photographs between these two parts of the 60s, but were these differences merely the natural changes in a young man’s face as he fluctuates in weight and grows older or something more sinister?</p><p>Advocates of the Paul is Dead theory maintain that the photographic anomalies are because we are looking at two different men, one the original Paul of the early 60s and the other his replacement, a McCartney look-alike named variously William Campbell, William Shepherd and Billy Shears.</p><p>The first rumblings that something may have happened to Paul began in December 1965, when he was involved in a much publicised moped accident whilst visiting his family in Liverpool. The injuries sustained in this crash, especially Paul’s broken tooth, are clearly still evident in the videos for Rain and Paperback Writer filmed in May 1966.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-1965-1971.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The older Paul seems to have a longer, thinner face</div></figcaption></figure><p>Another accident occurred on the 7th January 1967 when McCartney's black Mini Cooper was written off in a crash on the M1 near London. However, the official story has it that the car was been driven by a student named Mohammed Hadjij at the time, not McCarney. </p><p>It seems these two relatively mundane incidents were becoming mangled across multiple retellings, spawning the far more sensational rumour that Paul had actually died in a car accident. Shortly afterwards, Beatles Monthly magazine attempted to quash the gossip by issuing a false report about the latter accident, dismissing any notion that there had been a crash at all, and stating that not only was Paul alive and well but his Mini Cooper car was also perfectly intact.</p><p>Was this false story designed to hide the tragic truth that Paul had really died? Whatever the truth, the Beatles’ story always unfolded in fast forward, and the two episodes were quickly forgotten amidst a torrent of other tabloid stories about the exploits of the Fab Four.</p><p>Apart from the odd piece of drug fuelled chatter during swinging London parties, the rumours about McCartney did not reemerge again until 1969, when the whole idea that Paul was dead took off in sensational fashion, gaining such credence in the mainstream media that it even spawned an extraordinary mock trial on American television prosecuted by famous attorney F. Lee Bailey.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/two-paul-mccartneys.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">This photograph from 1968 appeared to show two McCartneys</div></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the initial credit for the Paul is Dead theory belongs to a student at Michigan University called Fred LaBour. LaBour began to write about the idea in late 1969, initially inspired by a program on local radio where a Beatles fan named Tom Zarsky had phoned in claiming not only that Paul McCartney was dead, but that a sinister clue to this was hidden in The White Album track Revolution 9.</p><p>Following the callers instructions, the disc jockey at Michigan's WKNR-FM, Russ Gibb, played a portion of the song backwards live on air, stunning his listeners by revealing the apparent secret message ‘Turn me on dead man’.</p><p>LaBour’s subsequent article for the Michigan Student newspaper - ‘\"McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light\", cemented many of the key facets of the legend. Detailed were Paul's death in a car crash during the recording of Sgt Pepper in late 1966, the clues left in the album covers, the backward messages in the band's songs and the imposter William Shepherd.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/life-magazine-1969-paul-is-still-with-us.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Life Magazine November 1969 edition referenced the rumours</div></figcaption></figure><p>From here was born the whole feverish Paul is Dead craze of 1969, which prompted obsessive dormitory analysis of every second of the Beatles music for more clues, much speculation in the press and the aforementioned TV trial of the incredible theory on American TV. Paul himself was even put into the Kafkaesque position of being called out in the national media to prove he was alive.  </p><p>As is necessary for any good conspiracy, suspicious deaths were also added to the brew, with the untimely early demise of such prominent Beatles related figures as their manager Brian Epstein, roadie Mal Evans and even John Lennon himself all linked to the plot. Where they taken out to prevent them revealing the dark truth about Paul?</p><p>Of course most sensible people dismissed all of this as wild nonsense. The band had already admitted to deliberately putting gibberish references in their songs to tease fans and mind bending theories about the increasingly psychedelic and cryptic output of musicians like the Beatles was rife throughout the 60s.</p><p>Such outré speculation, critics argue, was the inevitable consequences of fandom and press desperate for any scrap of news about the Beatles. Once the real news ran out the temptation to start inventing new news must have been overwhelming for journalists knowing anything Fab Four related would sell more papers.</p><p>Some even suspected the Beatles themselves were behind the rumours, deliberately concocted as a way to bolster album sales. Although as the most successful band in history who continually broke sales records, it doesn't seem like they really needed the extra PR. </p><p>Most of the evidence offered up was so subjective and tendentious that it could prove nothing either way. But what of the incredible claims of two Italian forensic scientists, who in 2009 studied photographs of McCartney during the 60s and concluded the man claiming to be the famous musician post 1966 was not the same fresh faced mop top who sang Love Me Do in 1963?</p><p>Could the most outlandish of 60s conspiracy theories actually be true? Is Paul Dead?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Two of Us</h3><p>Whilst the idea that Paul was replaced with a look-alike sounds like the far-fetched plot of a comic book, there is in fact a long documented history of the use of doubles in politics, espionage and entertainment.</p><p>Hitler and Stalin employed multiple doubles, both as a decoy in case of assassination attempts and simply to do the mundane leg work of a busy dictator in the era before mass communications.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/stalin-lookalike.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Stalin and his look-alike Felix Dadaev</div></figcaption></figure><p>Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein took the idea to a new level, routinely utilizing look-alikes to disguise his true whereabouts, especially as his paranoia grew in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf war. By the time he, or perhaps one his his doppelgangers, was captured by US troops in 2003 it is thought he may have used more than a dozen look-alikes in the preceding decade.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous case of a double in modern times involved British WW2 general Bernard ‘Monty’ Montgomery. Solider M.E. Clifton, who bore a strong resemblance to Montgomery, was recruited by British intelligence to act as a decoy for the General.</p><p>Clifton then made trips to Gibraltar and Algiers in the guise of Monty, specifically to be seen and trailed by German intelligence so as to mislead them about the Allies invasion plans.</p><p>In the sphere of entertainment, impersonator Michael Clayton bore such an uncanny resemblance to comedian and actor Robin Williams that he was able to successfully pose as the star and attend events and gigs using his identity. By 2005 Williams would be forced to sue Clayton in order to stop the deception.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/general-montgomery-double.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">General Montgomery famously used a look-alike as a decoy</div></figcaption></figure><p>In 1968, hundreds of excited Andy Warhol fans attended his much publicised speaking tour of American universities. What most of them didn't realise until the hoax was exposed after the fact was that it was not Warhol they had payed to see but actor and ‘official double’ Allen Midgett.</p><p>In the world of music, a homeless man named Christopher Dickinson successfully passed himself off as former Kiss drummer Peter Criss for a time in the 1990s. Dickinson was living on the streets in Santa Monica when he began claiming to be Criss, convincing a string of prominent celebrities and Kiss fans to rally around and him get back on his feet.</p><p>This came as a surprise to the real Peter Criss, living happily with his wife and daughter and somewhat taken aback at the rumours he had fallen on such hard times. Criss would later have a memorably surreal confrontation with his imposter on the Phil Donahue show, where he asserted his bonafides as the genuine Kiss star.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/robin-williams-michael-clayton.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robin Williams and his imposter Michael Clayton</div></figcaption></figure><p>In the light of these and many similar stories, is it really so unlikely that the Paul McCartney we see today is an imposter? Of course such a prospect would far outstrip all other documented example of doubles in history both for its duration and the intense scrutiny it had had to withstand.</p><p>This fake Paul is now in his mid-70s, meaning he has spent far longer in the part than the original ever did, all the time as one of the most photographed, filmed and studied men in history. Is there any evidence amongst this vast catalogue of documentary evidence to back up the incredible theory?</p><h3>I’ve Just Seen a Face</h3><p>There were many thousands of photographs taken of McCartney during his 1960s heydey in the Beatles. If the rumours that he was replaced with an imposter in 1966 are really true then there must be evidence for it in at least some of these images.</p><p>Paul is Dead theorists point to late 1966 and early 1967 as the first appearances of the fake Paul, or ‘Faul’ as they call him. During this time McCartney seems to rapidly lose the round, slightly chubby face he had in the early 60s and sport a longer, slightly gaunter, more angular visage.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/mccartney-1964-1969.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The original McCartney and his alleged replacement</div></figcaption></figure><p>Was this too many late nights partying and taking drugs catching up with the singer or an obvious indication that he had been replaced with William Shepherd, a look-alike who was thinner than him? Other details appear to set the two eras of McCartney apart. The 1967 Paul has thinner lips and and a longer thinner nose, as well as flatter less arched eyebrows.</p><p>Most tellingly, the latter McCartney seems to sport detached earlobes, whereas the earlier models are attached. Barring some unknown surgical procedure or accident it’s not clear how this could be the case.</p><p>Proponents of the theory also point to other photographs showing the 1967 Paul to be noticeably taller than his predecessor. Pictures taken of the singer with his long term girlfriend Jane Asher in 1967 appear to show Paul several inches taller than Asher. Similar side by shots of the pair from before 1967 show Paul to be much closer in height to the actress.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-faul-ears.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul is Dead fans point to the differences in earlobes as some of the best evidence</div></figcaption></figure><p>Amateur photo-analysis is, however, a dangerous business. People can look very different in different pictures for a whole variety of entirely natural reasons. Countless other factors such as the lenses, lighting, perspective and cropping can also make a photo look unusual and anomalous.</p><p>For this reason, Paul is Dead advocates point to the startling conclusions of two Italian forensic scientists to bolster their claims. In a 2009 Wired Italia article, Francesco Gavazzeni and Gabriella Carlesi conducted a biometric analysis of images taken of the Beatle both before and after 1966 for what was originally intended to be a piece debunking the conspiracy theories.</p><p>To their surprise, the scientists found measurements of the shape of the skull and jaw, the curve of the jaw, the ear, palate and teeth displayed marked differences between the Pauls, leading them to conclude with a “high degree of probability” that they were in fact two different men.</p><p>“The mandibular curve between the two sets of photos showed a discrepancy of over 6 percent, well beyond the threshold of error. But there was more, before 1966 each side of the jaw is composed of two curves, since 1967 it appears to be a single curve”, the article explained.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-fake-italian-magazine.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Two Italian forensic scientists have backed the idea of a McCartney imposter</div></figcaption></figure><p>Gavazzeni and Carlesi outline several other significant morphological differences in Paul’s lips, eyes, nose and teeth; too many, they say, to be down to the natural fluctuations you would expect between different photos of the same person.</p><p>As convincing as this may seem there are some major caveats. Whilst Carlesi is a specialist in craniometry and odontology, Gavazenni is actually a computer scientist with no special qualification in facial anthropology. </p><p>Forensic science itself is somewhat of a misnomer, it is not a hard science but a highly subjective one heavily dependent on the interpretation of the individual specialist. Any high profile murder trial will have two teams of forensic experts testifying to often tangentially opposite conclusions based on the same evidence. Clearly, at least 50% of them must be wrong.</p><h3>Every Little Thing</h3><p>Of all the evidence offered for the Paul is Dead theory, perhaps what has most captured fans imaginations since 1969 is the analysis of the various clues that appear to be hidden in the Beatles’ music and album covers.</p><p>From secret messages that can only be heard when the band’s songs are played backwards to cryptic references in the album covers, theorists have pointed to dozens of subtle and not so subtle hints in the Beatles output that seemed to be suggesting something terrible had happened to Paul.</p><p>The first record alleged to feature the replacement McCartney was 1967’s Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band, said to contain a plethora of clues and references to original Paul’s recent death.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/sgt-pepper-beatles-1967.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">More clues to Paul’s death can be found in Peter Blake’s Sgt Pepper album cover</div></figcaption></figure><p>Much heralded as one of the first successful concept albums, it saw the Beatles taking on the guise of the eponymous Sgt Pepper band. Was this a direct reference to them leaving the ’old’ Beatles, featuring the now dead McCartney behind?</p><p>On the album’s cover the ‘new’ Beatles, in their psychedelic outfits, can be seen stood in front of what looks like a grave with the band's name depicted in flowers. Alongside the name is a wreath in the shape of a left handed guitar, the same orientation the original Paul famously played. </p><p>Directly below the central figure of Paul is the word ‘HEARTS’ written on a bass drum. When a mirror is placed horizontally dividing this word in half it reads ‘HE♦DIE’. Could this really just be a spooky coincidence or the product of overactive imaginations?</p><p>And what to make of the reverse cover of Sgt Pepper, with the image of the four Beatles in their elaborate costumes, with only Paul of the band stood with his back to the viewer? There is no obvious reason why only Paul is singled out like this, but as we shall see, it would become a recurring theme in future releases.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/sgt-pepper-he-die.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Does Sgt Pepper’s album cover contains hidden messages?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the cover, Sgt Pepper makes extensive use of studio technology to create complex soundscapes using multi-tracked vocals and backward masking. Whilst it was not uncommon for musicians of the era to use backwards vocals, the Beatles themselves used them before on singles like Rain, fans believes Sgt Pepper marks the start of a whole series of specific references to Paul's death in the band's music.</p><p>Does John Lennon's track Strawberry Fields Forever have him backwards singing “cranberry sauce”, as the official biographers tell us, or “I buried Paul” as Paul is Dead theorists maintain?</p><p>The closing track A Day in the Life is often regarded as Lennon and McCartney’s finest collaboration, but does the lyric “he blew his mind out in a car”, reference Paul's decapitation in a fatal car crash during the album's recording?</p><p>1967 proved to be incredibly fruitful creatively for the Beatles, with or without the real Paul, and their success continued with Magical Mystery Tour later in the year. Originally released as both double EP and Christmas holiday TV special, the surreal, psychedelic work has reaped rich rewards for Paul is Dead proponents in search of more evidence for their theory.</p><p>John Lennon's I Am The Walrus, with its nonsense, Lewis Carroll-esque lyrics was always rife for interaction and Paul would quickly become identified by fans with the Walrus of the title. Lennon playfully encouraged such rumours on his follow up track Glass Onion, in which he teases “here’s another clue for you all, the Walrus was Paul”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/beatles-i-am-the-walrus-1967.jpg?\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">I am The Walrus supposedly contains clues to Paul’s death</div></figcaption></figure><p>It is frequently cited in the Paul is dead conspiracy theories that this was a dark hint about Paul's fate, as walruses are often used as symbols of death in folklore. Whatever the case, Paul became so identified with the animal that he would be invited to play one 20 years later in the video for George Harrison's When We Was Fab.</p><p>The video for Paul’s song Your Mother Should Know contains what would become a running theme in the Beatles remaining albums, the singling out of Paul as somehow different to his fellow bandmates. In the video, staged as an old school song and dance number, John, George and Ringo are in tuxedos with a red rose on the lapel. Somewhat incongruously, Paul sports a black rose instead, a flower more closely associated with death.</p><p>What's interesting about this particular clue, is that Paul went out of his way to specifically deny it had any significance at all. In a 1969 Life interview he dismisses the strange disparity with a mundane explanation; during filming they had simply run out of red flowers, so he had to use a black one. </p><p>For some reason as yet unknown, it looks like Paul is lying about this. McCartney was actually the uncredited director of the entire sequence, in which he is clearly seen been handed a huge bouquet of red flowers, whilst sporting the discordant black flower on his lapel. It could not therefore be a shortage of props as he claimed, only a deliberate choice.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/beatles-your-mother-should-know-black-carnation.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul is the only Beatle with a black carnation in the video for Your Mother Should Know</div></figcaption></figure><p>There wasn't much for fans to dissect on the cover of their next release, 1968’s ‘The Beatles’, with its all white cover. But the sprawling double album features several more instances of backwards vocals. </p><p>Revolution 9, much mocked as the most skipped song in music history, and perhaps the only track played more often backwards than forwards, seemed to be the rosetta stone of Paul is Dead mythology. Whilst it admittedly takes some imagination to hear, one segment of Revolution 9 played in reverse does sound very much like “turn me on dead man”, which to fans looked like a reference to Paul, who famously sang “I love to turn you on” in A Day in the Life the previous year.</p><p>Another song on the album, Lennon’s I'm So Tired, ends with a piece of spoken gibberish that theorists believe says “Paul is dead man, miss him miss him” when played backwards, whilst the rare self penned Ringo effort Don’t Pass Me By has the drummer singing about a lost friend who died in a car crash, just as Paul was said to have done.</p><p>Moving on to 1969 the band released Abbey Road, with its iconic Iain Macmillan photograph of the musicians crossing the street near London’s Abbey Road studios. Coinciding, as it did, with the growing rumours about Paul’s death reaching critical mass, fans voraciously scoured the cover for more clues.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/beatles-abbey-road-1969.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul is barefoot on the famous Abbey Road cover</div></figcaption></figure><p>As was becoming customary, Paul is again depicted different to the other Beatles, being the only one of the four walking across the road barefoot. Was this, as many suggested, a reference to the traditional practice in many cultures of burying the dead barefoot and another hint from the band that Paul was in fact dead? </p><p>Further to the idea, In the background of the shot is a parked VW Beetle car with a number plate containing 28IF. Could this be another hint from the band about Paul, the Beatle who died in a car crash and would have been in his 28th year if he had lived?</p><p>To complete the theme of death, Macmillan frames the men in way that resembles a funeral procession, with Ringo even dressed uncannily like an undertaker for added measure. </p><p>The album cover of Let it Be, the band’s final release in 1970, again singles out Paul for special attention. Whilst John, George and Ringo are all looking leftwards on a white background, Paul is staring directly at the viewer, framed by a red backdrop. Is this yet another reference to the bloody demise of the original McCartney in 1966?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/let-it-be-album-cover.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul is the only Beatle on a red background on the cover of their last album</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many Beatles fans love to play armchair detective about all of this, without ever really believing it. Beyond treating the musicians’ output as a series of puzzles to be solved, how credible was the scenario really?</p><p>If Paul had been killed in an accident could they have replaced him with someone who not only looked just like him but had the same musical talent? Was there such a man waiting in the Wings, ready to take over and pass himself off as the real Paul?</p><p>Well here’s another clue for you all. In the early 60s, it was common for session musicians to exploit popular acts by quickly recording cover versions of their songs and releasing them in the guise of fake bands. The Beatles, with their massive international success, suffered from this more than anyone.</p><p>One such fake band, the intriguingly named Billy and the Pepperpots, released a couple of Merseymania albums in 1964, three years before Sgt Pepper.  The albums were a mix of Beatles covers and Beatles-esque original songs. The author of these original songs? One Bill Shepherd.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Magical Mystery Tour</h3><p>Although now chiefly associated with the internet, the phenomenon of fake news and celebrity death hoaxes is by no means new, with classic era stars as diverse as Charlie Chaplin, Frank Sinatra and Doris Day subject to unfounded reports of their death at one time or another.</p><p>In 1966, the year the first Paul is Dead whispers emerged, his contemporary Bob Dylan was at the centre of a very similar story that he had died in an horrific motorbike crash and replaced with a imposter less critical of US involvement in Vietnam.</p><p>The origins of many of these rumours are obscure, if not a mix of garbled misreporting and chinese whispers then perhaps somebody's idea of a joke. And in almost all cases they quickly fizzled out after it became apparent the star in question was indeed alive and well.</p><p>What sets Paul is Dead apart is how enduring it has proven to be, even today subject of hundreds of youtube videos and internet articles, many of them produced by people who weren't even born when the speculation first spread like wildfire through college campuses in 1969.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-is-dead-hoax.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The theory became a sensation in the press in 1969</div></figcaption></figure><p>Crucially, it also differs from most of the earlier rumours by having a very clear provenance. We can trace most of the Paul is Dead stories back to their source, and by doing see an obvious urban legend being constructed.</p><p>The canonical version of the story, that during the recording of Sgt Pepper in late 1966 Paul McCartney died in a car crash and was replaced by a look-alike, was largely made up by a 21 year-old student journalist at Michigan University called Fred LaBour.</p><p>LaBour had been amused by talk on local radio about supposed backward messages hidden on the Beatles records and decided, as a creative exercise, to run with the idea and spin out the whole incredible tale. </p><p>Little did he know what he had intended to be a joke would become one of the greatest conspiracy fables of all time. Most of the purported facts in LaBour’s October 14th Michigan Daily news article weren't even rumours he heard, but things he simply invented to add more colour to his article.</p><p>It was LaBour who devised the idea of a look-alike named William Campbell (Shepherd in other versions of the story) replacing McCartney, and LaBour who invented the much repeated idea that the Walrus, as in ‘The Walrus was Paul’ is a Greek symbol for death. Outside of the writer's imagination, it isn't.</p><p>The young writer was astonished when his little spoof quickly exploded out of the confines of his student paper and started being covered as a serious story by national media giants like Time and Life. LaBour had inadvertently created a monster, which was now trampling its way around the global press. </p><p>As the frenzy erupted, LaBour was invited onto the RKO TV special in which the theory was subjected to a mock trial led by lawyer F. Lee Bailey, but by this point he had become somewhat daunted by how his joke had seemingly taken on a life of its own.</p><p>“I told Bailey during our pre-show meeting that I’d made the whole thing up”, LaBour told Michigan Today in 2009. “He sighed, and said, ‘Well, we have an hour of television to do. You’re going to have to go along with this.’ I said OK.”</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-death-student-newspaper.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Stories spread like wildfire around American university campuses</div></figcaption></figure><p>LaBour remains philosophical about the fact many of the things he’d made up as a college student 50 years ago are now reported on the internet as fact. “Like it or not, the rumor will be with us as long as the Beatles are with us.”</p><p>All four of the Beatles repeatedly rubbished any idea that had put these secret references in their albums, putting it down to the overactive imagination of their fans. Paul himself still has to regularly field questions about whether he is dead or not, including an appearance on the Letterman Show in 2009 where he laughed off the theory as down to “the fame and the craziness”.</p><p>Lennon, whose lyrics are central to many of the Paul is Dead theories, admitted on many occasions he was simply making it all up. “I threw the line in - the Walrus was Paul - just to confuse everybody a bit more”, he explained in a 1980 interview with Playboy. “I was having a laugh because there'd been so much gobbledygook about Pepper - play it backwards and you stand on your head and all that.”</p><p>Some of the Beatles’ own denials might best be taken with a pinch of salt, however. John is also on the record as saying his Sgt Pepper track Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds had nothing to do with LSD, despite its initials spelling out the word and its content sounding decidedly influenced by the drug.</p><h3>Do You Want to Know a Secret</h3><p>It's difficult to imagine a more unlikely place to keep a secret than the music scene of the late 60s, especially one as mind-boggling audacious and elaborate as switching one of the world's most famous men with a double.</p><p>Unlike the other three Beatles, Paul spent the height of the Swinging Sixties living in central London, and was a regular fixture at hundreds of nightclubs, concerts and art happenings. During this time his social and professional circle was vast, from a plethora of other musicians, celebrities and artists, to countless peripheral associates and hangers on.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-mccartney-1980-drugs-amsterdam.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul in Amsterdam in 1980</div></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the near endless supply of words written by those who had a brush with the various Beatles during this time, not a single person has ever come forward with any suspicions that McCartney was anyone other than who he was claiming to be. Not even those that saw him virtually every day for years; friends, family or professional colleagues has ever vouched the slightest suspicion that the person they knew well had suddenly become someone else.</p><p>Anyone who genuinely knew McCartney and suspected the switch would be assured vast sums of money from the tabloid press for their story, many before them had for far less sensational tales of the Fab Four, yet nobody ever did.</p><p>It would take some immensely complex operation, involving thousands of people under lifetime secrecy agreements for the conspiracy to still be intact today, and to what end? The Beatles broke up nearly 50 year ago, a beloved part of our popular culture but no longer any kind of active outfit. What difference would it make now if it came out they replaced their bassist with a look-alike in 1966? </p><p>There is, however, a far more sinister variation on the conspiracy theory. Is the continued cover-up about Paul’s death because it was a psyop of some kind, perhaps designed to steer our popular culture in a certain direction or shape young people's attitudes to drugs?</p><p>If that is the case then the abilities of the dark forces that create our reality are all encompassing. If they can replace prominent public figures and keep an airtight cover-up about it for 50 years, then it is a truly scary prospect as to what else they might be doing to manipulate our perceptions of the world.</p><h3>Maybe I’m Amazed</h3><p>There aren't many artists in popular music who could rip through a throat shredding rock and roll song like She’s A Woman as well as Paul McCartney. Fewer still had the vocal delicacy to do justice to love songs like Here, There and Everywhere. And how many could also have written those songs?</p><p>Both were recorded before Paul’s alleged death in November 1966 and are regarded as classics of popular music. This Paul’s skills as a vocalists, writer and multi instrumentalist are widely heralded. </p><p>It was always the most fantastical part of the whole theory that the conspirators were able to produce someone who not only looked exactly the same as the now deceased McCartney, but improbably possessed the same high level of musical talent as well.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/mccartney-2016.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">McCartney is still going strong in his mid 70s</div></figcaption></figure><p>If Paul really is dead, then the man belting out the later Beatles tracks, like the rip roaring Oh Darling from Abbey Road, or whose lilting vocals lent Hey Jude and Let It Be so much of their power, is at least his equal. Paul’s highly distinctive bass playing, so influential on generations of subsequent musicians, is also perfectly mimicked by his replacement.</p><p>Do you need to be a Beatles fan to appreciate how absurd this is? Everyone who ever fell in love with the band, from those giddy early days in 1963 to their bitter breakup in 1970, feels like they know the Fab Four like family. Almost every second of their lives in that seven years of concentrated fame was recorded on film or record for us to endlessly analyse.</p><p>Beyond the inherent far out nature of the Paul is Dead theory, true fans know in the hearts that the Paul of She Loves You and a Hard Day’s Night is the same Paul of Let It Be and Maybe I’m Amazed. It doesn't matter what esoteric references and obscure clues appear on the internet.</p><p>The personality, the music, the voice, it’s undoubtedly the same man. To entertain the idea that it’s an uncanny double is to enter a far more surreal world than anything the Beatles themselves conjured up even at the height of their psychedelic period.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man/paul-mccartney-concert-2010-Y2kcrazyjoker4.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Paul McCartney in concert in 2010</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Beatles themselves often reflected on the metaphysical, and thats a suitable place to end this magical mystery tour. Whoever the man who continues, in his mid 70s, to entertain millions of people around the world in exhausting three hour concerts is the real Paul in any sense that really matters.</p><p>At one McCartney concert during his US tour of 2002, a man in his 40s can be seen openly weeping at Paul’s brilliant rendition of All My Loving, a song he wrote way back as a 21 year old in 1963. Like all great music, it had triggered evocative memories of this man’s past, his loves both present and lost. This is what Paul’s music means to millions of people around the world.</p><p>There is nothing fake about the man’s tears, nor McCartney's performance. The singer's voice may now be diminished by age, but what remains so beguiling about McCartney’s music is the fact we know this still vital old man before us is the same bright light that lit up the world all those years ago in the dark days following the assassination of President Kennedy.</p><p>Paul Is Dead? Not at all. Paul is very much still alive, and like all the Beatles living and dead, he always will be.</p>","tile":"paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man","path":"paul-is-dead-turn-me-on-dead-man","date":"2021-05-31T12:34:47.967Z","formatteddate":"May 31, 2021","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Paul is Dead","subheadline":"Turn Me On <span>Dead Man</span>","snippet":"Was Beatles legend Paul McCartney killed in 1966 and replaced with a look-alike?","tags":["beatles","paul","mccartney","death","accident","weird","unexplained","music","film","conspiracy","1969","london","abbey road","look-alike","imposter"],"title":"Paul is Dead - Turn Me On Dead Man","tileheadline":"Turn Me On Dead Man"},{"body":"<p>-gerardus-mercator-jodocus-hondius.jpg</p><p>In October 1929, on a dusty, forgotten shelf in an ancient library in Istanbul, an old map was found that might just rewrite human history.</p><p>Dated to 1513, the map showed the Atlantic ocean and the coastlines of South America, West Africa and Europe.

How could these early map makers have known about the continent?</p><p>Professor Charles Hapgood of Keene State College was intrigued by Mallery’s claims and picked up on his research. Hapgood studied not only Piri Reis’ map but others from around the same period and came to some sensational conclusions.</p><p>According to Hapgood, these maps not only showed Antarctica, but the continent coastline as it would have been more than 6,000 years ago, before the vast ice sheet that still covers it today had formed.</p><p>If Hapgood was right, the entire history of our civilization was in error.

These ancient mariners must have made their maps before the glaciers had formed — before 4,000BC. Such a prospect would have staggering consequences for our history.</p><p>Advanced civilizations were not thought to have arisen until around 3,000BC, with the first sophisticated seafaring cultures developing during the following millennia.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/antartica.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Antarctica has been under ice for more than 6000 years (Credit: Liam Quinn)</div></figcaption></figure><p>But Hapgood’s conclusions tore up the history books.

Author Graham Hancock made the maps a central part of his book Fingerprint of the Gods, arguing that the human race had amnesia about this lost period in our history.</p><p>Do these mysterious maps prove a lost civilization existed in prehistory?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>The Piri Reis map</h3><p>In 1954, the US Navy’s map making department — the hydrographic office, received a copy of the Piri Reis map from a Turkish admiral. As one of the world’s leading authorities in maritime mapping, the Turks hoped the bureau could shed some light on the mysterious chart.</p><p>The hydrographic office drafted in Arlington Mallery, a retired US Navy captain who specialised in ancient maps. Mallery’s findings were radical — the map accurately depicted the subglacial northern coast of Antarctica.</p><p>The hydrographic office concurred. They were astounded by the accuracy of the map, going as far as to say it must have been compiled with the help of aerial surveying.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/antartica-discovery-1820.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Antarctica wasn’t officially discovered until 1820</div></figcaption></figure><p>M.I. Walters, a cartographer with the bureau, said in a radio interview at Georgetown University — “We have taken the old charts and the new charts that the Hydrographic Office produces today and made comparisons of the soundings of salient peaks and mountains. We have found them to be in astounding agreement”.</p><p>Professor Charles Hapgood, a historian and geographer at Keene State College, was fascinated by Mallery’s claims and decided to investigate himself.</p><p>With the help of his students, Hapgood quickly came to the same conclusion, but felt it wise to get a second opinion on the map’s accuracy before he took it further. Consulting the US Air Force’s cartographical department, the professor received a ringing endorsement.</p><p>In a letter to Hapgood, they said “The claim that the lower part of the map portrays the Princess Martha Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctic, and the Palmer Peninsular, is reasonable.</p><blockquote><span>\"We have taken the old charts and the new charts that the Hydrographic Office produces today…we have found them to be in astounding agreement.\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>We find that this is the most logical and in all probability the correct interpretation of the map. The geographical detail shown in the lower part of the map agrees very remarkably with the results of the seismic profile made across the top of the ice-cap by the Swedish-British Antarctic Expedition of 1949.”</p><p>The USAF concluded — “ This indicates the coastline had been mapped before it was covered by the ice-cap. The ice-cap in this region is now about a mile thick. We have no idea how the data on this map can be reconciled with the supposed state of geographical knowledge in 1513. “</p><p>Hapgood was now convinced. The Piri Reis map showed the subglacial topography of Antarctica. And the only way this was possible was that it was mapped by a sophisticated lost civilisation more than 6,000 years ago, before the ice sheet had formed over the continent.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/surveying-expedition-antarctica-1950s.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Surveying expeditions first accurately mapped Antarctica in the 1950s (credit: Tom LC)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The professor published the findings in his book ‘Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings’ in 1966. Whilst the book’s conclusions were rejected by mainstream science, they were embraced by alternative history authors such as Eric Von Daniken and Graham Hancock.</p><p>In order to further prove its thesis, the book had gone far beyond the work of the US Navy and Arlington Mallery. Because Hapgood had found more maps, some even more inexplicable than that of Piri Reis.</p><h3>The Oronteus Finaeus map</h3><p>Hapgood’s work on the Piri Reis map was attacked by some critics. Had he simply misidentified Antarctica? Hapgood was aware he needed more than Piri Reis and set about trying to find more evidence.</p><p>He spent weeks pouring through medieval maps in the Library of Congress in Washington for depictions of Antarctica. It was not uncommon for maps from that period to show a conjectured southern continent, but their depictions were works of imagination.</p><p>Hapgood recounts in Maps how he eventually found the real thing. “Then one day, I turned a page and sat transfixed. As my eyes fell upon the Southern Hemisphere of a world map drawn by Oronteus Fineaus in 1531, I had the instant conviction that I had found here a truly authentic map of the real Antarctica”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/oronteus-finaeus-map-1531.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Oronteus Finaeus map of 1531</div></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the Piri Reis map, Oronteus Fineaus showed the entire Antarctic continent. Fine details of mountains and rivers could be seen in the coastal portions of the landmass.</p><p>Dr. Richard Strachan of MIT studied the map for Hapgood and concluded that it depicted non-glacial conditions in coastal regions of Antarctica. According to Strachan, these closely matched modern seismic survey maps of the subglacial topography of the continent.</p><p>Like Piri Reis, Oronteus Fineaus had based his map on much older sources. For Hapgood, this could only mean that ancient mariners must have mapped the coast more than 6,000 years ago, when it was free of ice.</p><p>This was long before mainstream history tells us mankind had the ability to do so. Was this more evidence for an advanced civilization lost to history?</p><h3>The Bauche Map</h3><p>Perhaps Hapgood’s most amazing discovery was the world map of 1737 produced by French cartographer Phillipe Bauche.</p><p>Bauche’s map was unique in that it showed the whole of Antarctica, including the interior, as it appeared under the ice. The modern world would not match this feat until seismic surveys in 1958 mapped the whole subglacial topography of the continent.</p><p>What was especially perplexing about the Bauche map is that it showed features not present even on modern maps.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/bauche-map-1737.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Bauche map of 1737</div></figcaption></figure><p>Bauche depicted an ice free waterway dividing the continent into two landmasses. Although Antarctic is still today shown as one landmass, it is actually an archipelago of smaller islands separated by huge masses of ice.</p><p>As with the other anomalous maps, Bauche claimed to have compiled them from much older sources, revealing again the possibility of some distant lost civilization with sophisticated map making skills.</p><p>But the Bauche map was far more problematic than any of the other’s Hapgood had studied. Geologists tell us that no inland waterways have existed in Antarctica for millions of years, a time before modern human beings existed at all, let alone ones capable of map making.</p><p>If the Bauche map really does depict an ice free Antarctica, then it asks a troubling question about our history for which, as yet, we have no rational answer.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Lost at sea</h3><p>The appearance of Antarctica in medieval maps provides tantalizing evidence for the existence of a lost civilization in prehistory.</p><p>But the idea rests on the correct identification of Antarctica, something which is fiercely disputed. If the land masses shown in the Piri Reis map and others aren’t actually Antarctica, then the whole theory turns to dust.</p><p>Could Charles Hapgood, Erich Von Daniken and Graham Hancock have let their imaginations get the better of them?</p><p>Critics point out that the depiction of Antarctica in most of the maps is far from accurate. The continent as depicted in the Piri Reis and Oronteus Fineaus maps bears only a passing resemblance to the true Antarctica.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/terra-australis-medieval-map.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Medieval maps often depicted a theoretical southern continent called Terra Australis</div></figcaption></figure><p>The similarity is perhaps only marginally greater than you might expect from chance, and certainly isn’t unmistakeable enough for us to be sure there was any real geographical knowledge behind its production.</p><p>Bauche’s map is even less accurate. Whilst it is one of the few maps that predate the 20th century to show Antarctica as not a single landmass, it otherwise looks nothing like the continent.</p><p>Crucial to this point is that whilst Antarctica wasn’t officially discovered until 1820, conjecture that there was a southern continent at the bottom of the planet goes back as far as the Ancient Greeks.</p><p>This undiscovered continent, known as ‘Terra Australis’, is often shown in maps from the same era, depicted from the cartographer’s imagination. Could it be that what appears to be Antartica in these maps is just this theorized southern land mass?</p><p>Any vague resemblance could be down to luck, or perhaps pieced together through word of mouth from mariners who had made unrecorded visits to the continent’s coastline in the centuries before its official discovery.</p><p>As for the Piri Reis map, the mysterious chart that started it all, critics offer a far more mundane explanation for its strange out of time portrayal of Antarctica.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/piri-reis-mystery-of-the-maps/queen-maud-land.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Piri Reis has Queen Maud Land incongruously connected to South America (credit: Wilfred Bauer)</div></figcaption></figure><p>What’s claimed to be the coastline of Queen Maud land is incongruously connected to South America.

Contrary to Italian law, Luciani was embalmed less than a day after his death, before proper medical evaluation of the cause and with no death certificate issued.</p><p>Although not strictly bound by Italian law, the Vatican had followed normal procedure and waited more than a day to embalm the previous Pope. This time it seems they acted with almost obscene haste — Yallop claims that the papal embalmers the Signoracci brothers were called in as early as 5:30AM, just 45 minutes after the discovery of the body and before Luciani has even been examined by a doctor.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/pope-john-paul-1-murder-at-the-vatican/pope-john-paul-laying-in-state.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The body of the pope laying in state</div></figcaption></figure><p>Equally odd was the fact no organs or blood were removed during the embalming process, as would occur normally.

But the Vatican seemed determined to prevent this possibility.</p><p>The question of whether an autopsy was conducted on Luciani is shrouded in mystery. The Vatican publicly maintained that there was no autopsy as it was against papal doctrine. But the Italian press and David Yallop found evidence that a secret autopsy had indeed been conducted.</p><p>If the pope had simply died of a heart attack why were the Vatican behaving in such a strange and furtive way?</p><h3>Good health</h3><p>According to Dr. Buzzonati, Pope John Paul I’s cause of death was a heart attack. However, with no obvious signs of trauma only an autopsy could properly determine the cause of death.</p><p>To reinforce their account the Vatican began briefing the press that the pope had heart problems, but this was quickly rubbished by his own personal doctor Guiseppe Da Ros, as well as his family and friends.</p><p>“In my family almost no one believes it was a heart attack that killed my uncle. He never had heart trouble or any illness of that kind.”, his niece told the press.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/pope-john-paul-1-murder-at-the-vatican/pope-john-paul-family-death.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Luciani’s family were sceptical of the heart attack verdict</div></figcaption></figure><p>At the family’s insistence, Luciani’s medical report from 6 months prior to his death was printed in the Italian press.

The only survivor of the Seven Wonders of the World, it contains some unusual features that have long resisted explanation.</p><p>Both the King and Queen’s Chamber in the pyramid have two mysterious 8-inch wide shafts, unique in all Egypt, that travel out diagonally through hundreds of feet of the pyramid’s vast body.</p><p>These shafts would have been unfathomably complex to construct — each of hundreds of thousands of blocks had to be separately carved into shape to form the shaft. Clearly they were of fundamental importance.</p><p>Whilst traditionally described as ventilation shafts by egyptologists, this is unlikely to be their true purpose since two of the shafts do not connect with the exterior of the monument.</p><p>They do, however, exhibit several significant astronomical alignments that reinforce the Orion correlation theory.</p><p>The astronomer Virginia Trimble noticed in 1964 that the southern shaft in the King’s Chamber pointed towards Orion — the very constellation mapped out on the ground by the three pyramids. Could this really be another coincidence?</p><p>Robert Bauval then traced the path of the southern shaft of the Queen’s chamber and discovered it pointed at Sirius.

It could be that topological problems with the underlying rock necessitated a change in location.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/pyramids-of-giza-the-orion-mystery/menkaure-pyramid.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Plans for Menkaure’s pyramid appear to have changed mid-build</div></figcaption></figure><p>The smaller third pyramid, whose offset so distinctly mirrors Orion’s belt, also seems to have been replanned during its construction.

But the military men and women at Rendlesham Forest in England will always remember the Christmas of 1980, when they were witness to one of the most extraordinary UFO encounters in history.</p><p>The events that unfolded over that Christmas weekend are sometimes called Britain's Roswell. With dozens of trained military witnesses and official documents, it is cited as the best documented of all UFO cases, one even the most forthright of sceptics have failed to explain away.</p><p>RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters were known as the Twin Bases. Separated by an area of woodland called Rendlesham Forest, the two  installations in Suffolk, South East England were perhaps the United States most important military complex during the cold war. And they held a dark secret.</p><p>This secret was not from beyond the stars, as some suspect of the UFO that visited the bases that Christmas in 1980, but man made. Even today, it's not officially acknowledged that nuclear weapons were being stored at the bases; a violation of the US and UK's treaty obligations like this would still be a major scandal 35 years later.</p><p>Some believe the solution to the mystery of the Rendlesham Forest Incident lies in the clandestine contents of the weapons storage area at Bentwaters. Indeed many of the witnesses to whatever it was in the woods that weekend think it was more interested in the bunkers than them.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/bentwaters-sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The events centered around the twin bases of RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters</div></figcaption></figure><p>But unlike so many UFO cases, to understand Rendlesham we don't need to rely on wild speculation or any dubious latter-day recollections. The case is unique in that we have an audit trail of official documents, contemporary accounts of those that were there and most remarkably of all, an audio tape made as senior US Air Force staff encountered a mysterious entity they now believe could not have been from Earth.</p><p>It probably not much fun to be on security duty on Christmas night, thousands of miles from home in a cold British military base on the east coast of England. 20-year-old American patrol sergeant John Burroughs had the short straw that night, guarding RAF Woodbridge's lonely east gate which edged into the dark woods of neighbouring Rendlesham forest. </p><p>As the 25th turned into the 26th, Burroughs looked out into the darkness and saw something strange; colored lights appeared to be hovering and dancing over the trees. Was is some kind of Christmas display? Burroughs had an uneasy feeling that it was something unusual and drove back to the gate house to inform the security controller.</p><p>Security Policeman Jim Penniston joined Burroughs at the gate to observe the lights. In his two years working at the base, the 26-year-old Penniston had never seen lights in the Rendlesham woods before, but had witnessed several small aircraft crashes during his career and felt that might explain what the men were seeing. </p><p>Relating this possibility to the security tower, at around 3am Penniston, Burroughs and fellow airman Ed Cabansag were given permission to venture out into the forest to investigate. The men were tentative, even the trained military professionals found the prospect of driving into the winter woods at night to investigate mysterious lights slightly unnerving.</p><blockquote><span>\"The air was filled with electricity\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>The small party followed the lights as far as they could in their jeep, then ventured out into the woodland to investigate further by foot. Penniston was sure he could see the outline of an object in the distance, but by now was certain it was no light aircraft. </p><p>\"The air was filled with electricity\", Penniston recalled. \"You could feel it on your skin as we approached the object\". The men were now on edge, even their radios appeared to have stopped working properly. Reaching a small clearing, Penniston took out a small notebook, determined to capture every detail of the incredible scene before him.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1211\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/landing-site.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Photograph of Suffolk Police inspecting the supposed landing site</div></figcaption></figure><p>The two men differ on what the craft looked like, but both concur it did not appear like anything made on earth. About 9 by 6ft in size, triangular and composed of a smooth, glass-like material with unusual symbols adorning its surface, they were transfixed by the strange vehicle for almost 20 minutes. Underneath a strong bright light pulsated and red and blue lights swirled around its edges. </p><p>Penniston scribbled furiously in his notebook, drawing as best he could the shape of the object, but found it increasingly difficult to write as if some strange force was weighing him down. Then, without ever acknowledging their existence, it suddenly shot off  into the sky and disappeared entirely from view.</p><p>Penniston's notebook reveals his palpable sense of astonishment at what he was seeing. \"Liftoff 2.45. No sound. No air disturbance. Takeoff. Unknown speed. Impossible.\"</p><p>What on earth had the man witnessed? Whatever it was was, all three were reluctant to go back to their commanding officers and say they had seen an alien spaceship. rumours had long circulated around the twin bases of lights in the skies, but most airmen preferred to keep such reports to themselves for fear of ridicule.</p><p>On returning to the base, the men relayed what Penniston described as a 'sanitised' account of the encounter to their commanding officer Lt Fred Buran and were informed that the nearby radar base had also reported an unusual blip on their radar earlier the previous night. Was this the object the men had seen?</p><p>Like so much of the Rendlesham incident, we have official documents that confirm that this incident did indeed occur. Buran's typewritten report dated January 2nd 1981 confirms Burroughs and Penniston's sighting. Fred Buran affirms that the men are reliable and mature individuals and appeared convinced that Penniston had indeed experienced something 'out of the realm of explanation for him at that time'.</p><p>By now, the strange lights over Rendlesham had also been reported to the local police. Returning the next morning with two officers from the Suffolk constabulary, Burroughs and Penniston tried to find the location of their mysterious nocturnal encounter. </p><p>Happening upon the what they believed was the same clearing, the men saw three indentations in the ground. Often seized on by skeptics, the subsequent police report states that these indentations were actually rabbits burrows. Penniston, however, is adamant they were not - \"the ground was frozen and it was just impossible for that to have happened\", he stated in a SciFi television documentary.</p><p>Penniston believes the officers were reluctant to state what the marks really were as, like him, they were worried they would be ridiculed. Supportive of Penniston's integration was the fact the three indentations formed an exact equilateral triangle when measured out.</p><p>Burroughs and Penniston's encounter in the woods might well have been dismissed as a mistake, or even Christmas hijinks, if it wasn't for the events of the following two nights.</p><p>Although the Rendlesham Forest Incident is usually reported as two nights of UFO activity, the 25-26 and 27-28th, there was actually a lesser reported sighting the following night. Twenty hours after the Burroughs and Penniston sighting, 18-year old basic airman Lori Boeon recalls seeing more lights during her midnight shift guarding the east gate.</p><p>Against a black sky, Boeon saw a ball of orange-red light descend into the forest northwards of her guard post. Five of Boeon's senior colleagues also saw the lights, speculating amongst themselves that it may be the British celebrating New Year early.</p><p>News of the UFO sightings had by now reached to the base's deputy commander Colonel Charles Halt. Whilst attending a Christmas awards party at the base on the night of the 27th, an ashen faced Lt. Bruce Englund rushed in and told Halt -\"We've got to talk now, it's back!\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/east-gate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The sightings began around the isolated east gate at Woodbridge (Credit: Taras Young)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Halt, then a 41-year-old veteran of Vietnam and Korea, had little truck with tales of UFOs and was irritated that his men were getting distracted from their duties with such nonsense. Determined to find the source of the lights once and for all, Halt led a search party into Rendlesham Forrest to look for answers. </p><p>Halt himself was equipped with a small handheld dictaphone and his 18-minute tape of the party's expedition into the woods contains some of the strongest evidence presented in any UFO case. As the men roamed the woods and out into a nearby farmers field, Halt can be heard describing his observations of a red-orange light hovering over the forest, zipping about at unimaginable speeds and directing beams down into the twin bases.</p><blockquote><span>\"...it's back again...it's coming this way...there's no doubt about it...this is weird!\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>As his voice gets visibly more excited, Halt says - \"see it too...it's back again...it's coming this way...there's no doubt about it...this is weird...it looks like an eye winking at you...it almost burns your eyes...he's coming toward us now!\"</p><p>Sceptics have pointed out that light from the nearby Orfordness lighthouse filtering and scattering through the branches may have been what the men were seeing. Could the experienced military men really be mistaking a lighthouse for a UFO?</p><p>Just like Burroughs and Penniston's encounter, the men were hampered by mysterious failures to both their radio equipment and the portable floods lights they were using to search the forest. </p><p>Staff Sergeant Monroe Nevels accompanied Halt as they inspected the landing site from the previous night. Nevels was armed with a giga-counter found unusually high readings around the three indentions in the ground.</p><p>What worried Halt was the beams of light the object was firing towards the ground. Halt says he heard over his radio that RAF Bentwaters were also reporting light beams over the base. What might have been a curious distraction in the woods now looked like a serious security issue.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/lighthouse.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sceptics suggest the lights could have been the nearby Orfordness lighthouse (Credit: David Merrett)</div></figcaption></figure><p>After hours following the lights around the woods, the object appeared to break up into smaller pieces, then suddenly vanish. Further smaller white lights were then seen sporadically in the sky for hours afterwards, </p><p>From his point on, many of those present during this search believe a vast and clandestine cover-up began, under the nose of even a senior officer like Colonel Halt.</p><p>Whilst Halt himself tried to find out from his men what had happened, other agencies swooped in to interrogate the men about the events of the previous three nights. Jim Penniston recalls been repeatedly grilled about the incidents by the Air Force's Office of Intelligence, even being administrated truth drug Sodium Pentothal on one occasion.</p><p>Sgt Adrian Bustinza claims he was interrogated for hours in an underground part of the base by unnamed agents, possibly from the CIA. Ed Cabansag, who had accompanied Burroughs and Penniston on the first night of activity, says he was ordered to sign a false statement that concealed what he really saw. </p><p>Wing commander Charles Gabriel, in charge of all USAF forces in Europe, made an unprecedented impromptu visit to the bases, seizing much of Halt's evidence. Unbelievably, Halt was then told the United States had no official interest in the incident. </p><p>Unsure exactly what to do, and with jurisdiction over the matter officially shared between the US and UK, Halt was told to hand the matter over to the British Ministry of Defence. Halt's January 13th 1981 memo entitled 'unexplained lights' summarizing the events of the weekend was sent British government but received a similar lack of interest.</p><p>For all those involved, this seemed to mark the end of the matter. Life on the base got back to normal. Unlike many other cases nothing was made public, there were no false stories about swamp gas or weather balloons or the planet Jupiter. </p><p>Outside of a bit of gossip amongst UFOlogists, events of that amazing weekend would probably have become just another X-file, hidden away in a dusty basement somewhere. That was until a sensational tabloid scoop nearly three years later blew the whole thing wide open.</p><p>'UFO LANDS IN SUFFOLK...and that's OFFICIAL', the UK's News of the World roared. The paper had managed to obtain Halt's top secret memo and was gleefully reporting its contents, aswell as adding their own imaginative embellishments.</p><p>This story understandably made a big splash. This wasn't an anonymous source, it was the words of a senior American Air Force Colonel in an official memo. The seeming credibility of the document even lead to questions being asked of the then conservative government in the UK parliament.</p><p>Over the next few decades, competing claims would emerge about what happened over Christmas 1980 at the twin bases. More witnesses would emerge, often with incredible claims that were scarcely believable. Sceptics would pounce on inconsistencies and try to find rational explanations for what happened. </p><p>American Airmen Larry Warren had been anonymously leaking stories about Rendlesham to the UFO community for years, and his remarkable account of what he saw would prove to be very divisive amongst the other witnesses.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/burroughs-penniston.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">From left - John Burroughs and Jim Penniston</div></figcaption></figure><p>Warren's take on what happened in the woods varied significantly from Burroughs, Penniston and Halt's. According to the then 19-year-old Warren, it wasn't just lights or a craft the search part found in the early hours of the 28th, it was actual alien beings. Was the Rendlesham Forest Incident far more profound than anyone was letting on?</p><p>Warren would also make some startling claims about how men in black style agents had interrogated him and messed with is mind, possibly planting false or distorted memories. Rendlesham Forest was starting to move from a well-documented encounter with a mysterious light to what looked like full-scale science fiction.</p><p>Critics seized upon people like Larry Warren and the numerous inconsistencies between witnesses. Many, such as Jim Penniston, appear to be telling quite diffierent stories today than they told their commanding officers back in 1980. Was the story been rewritten for dramatic effect?</p><p>Some have even suggested the whole thing was a hoax, or that the airmen had had a bit too much Christmas cheer. Or perhaps it was simply a mistake, the nearby Orfordness lighthouse or an old Soviet rocket burning up in the atmosphere?</p><p>Regardless of the attempts to debunk Rendlesham, the original witnesses, the documents and the physical evidence all attest to something very genuine occurring at Rendlesham in 1980. Had the men really encountered an alien craft?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Halt Memo</h3><p>The most cited piece of evidence in the Rendlesham Forest case is the so-called Halt memo, deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt's summary of the events of the Christmas weekend in 1980 at the twin bases of RAF Woodbridge and Bentwaters.</p><p>Halt's memo provides a rare, direct piece of contemporary documentary UFO evidence signed by a senior member of the US military. Some critics have questioned the dating of this memo - January 13th, more than a fortnight after the incident occurred, but this appears to be explained by the general confusion over the jurisdiction over the incident.</p><p>RAF Woodbridge and RAF Brentwood were British air-force bases that were been leased to the US Air Force since 1952. There was a joint jurisdiction over the bases with the British technically having the primary role. The surrounding area, including Rendlesham forest where most of the activity occurred, were under sole British jurisdiction. </p><p>As such, Halt was told by his own commanders to hand the matter over to the British. With the base's British liaison Donald Moreland on leave, Halt elected to wait to act until he had discussed it with Moreland. With no further activity and no evidence of any threat, Halt no longer regarded the incident as especially urgent.</p><p>The Halt memo was released to the public in 1983 after the American Citizens Against UFO Secrecy organisation successfully launched a Freedom of Information to release the document. The story was then broken to the general public be the British News of the World newspaper. </p><p>Both the USAF and the British Ministry of Defence have consistently stated the activity detailed in the Halt memo is of no defence interest. Former UK Defense chief and Chairman of the NATO Military Committee Lord Hill-Norton thinks this stance is not believable, arguing that the events of Rendlesham were either genuine or several senior military staff are hallucinating or lying. He stated - \"Either of these simply must be 'of interest to the Ministry of Defense'\".</p><p>In the 1990s, whilst head of the MoD's UFO desk, researcher Nick Pope conducted a cold case review into the Rendlesham Incident.  According to Pope, the reality was that the MoD were unable to find any credible explanation for the incident and classified it as 'unexplained'. Pope thinks the original investigation was hobbled by confusion over jurisdiction, the wrong date quoted in Halt's memo, delays and some destruction of evidence.</p><p>Suspiciously, Charles A. Gabriel, the commander in chief of the USAF in Europe made an unscheduled trip to Bentwaters shortly after the incident. Gabriel was briefed about the incident and removed a large amount of evidence, much of which was never seen again.</p><p>Pope reveals that Gabriel's intervention caused disconnection at the MoD. It directly contradicts the official USAF line that they had no interest in the incident and that it should be handed over to the British. In fact, the MoD was never made aware of Gabriel's visit, what evidence he took and the results of any subsequent investigation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/charles-gabriel.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">General Charles Gabriel removed much of the Rendlesham evidence without British permission</div></figcaption></figure><p>Sceptics have long struggled to dismiss the Halt memo. Colonel Halt's credibility is difficult to question, he had a distinguished 42-year military career and retired in 1991 with the highest peacetime award given by the Secretary of Defense. He never publicly spoke about the incident until he retired and scrupulously sort permission before doing so.</p><p>Halt is, therefore, the most reputable senior military figure for which we have direct contemporary documentary evidence unambiguously discussing an encounter in any UFO case. Halt's memo rules out the idea the incident may have been some kind of joke fueled by yuletide spirit - a deputy commander of a nuclear facility like Halt would clearly never escalate such a hoax to the British government.</p><p>Whilst his memo cannot easily be dismissed, the deputy commander is also the source of arguably an even more convincing piece of evidence, in the form of an 18-minute audio tape of a real live UFO encounter.</p><h3>The Halt Tape</h3><p>After receiving more reports of lights, on the night of the 27th December deputy base commander Charles Halt took a party of men into Rendlesham Forest to try and determine their source. Halt's men were armed with flood lights, jeeps, radios and a geiger-counter. Halt himself took his trusted Lanier micro-cassette recorder he regularly used to dictate notes during base inspections.</p><p>Halts 18-minute tape of the party's seven-hour expedition in the woods is unique amongst all UFO cases in that it contains Halt and several other military personnel's live reactions to UFO phenomena occurring around them. The officers featured on the tape are Halt, Sgt. Monroe Nevels, Sgt Robert Ball, Sgt Adrian Bustinza and Lt. Bruce Englund.</p><p>The men can be heard inspecting the original landing site Burroughs and Penniston found two nights earlier. Disaster preparedness officer Nevels is heard to find unusual radiation readings at the site. Most of the rest of the tape contains the men's reactions to observing multiple unusual white and coloured lights flying around the forest and over the bases.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/charles-halt.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Now retired, Charles Halt continues to campaign to find the truth about Rendlesham</div></figcaption></figure><p>On several occasions, the men describe the object 'exploding' into smaller lights which then dart around laterally and vertically. This matches precisely the testimony of Rick Bobo, observing the lights from the weapons storage guard tower at Bentwaters - \"after it was hanging there a long while, I saw things shooting off it, really, really fast, like little sparks or something. Maybe four or five of them\", Bobo told researchers.</p><p>Towards the end of the tape, the objects start to beam rays of light or energy towards the ground. \"Now were observing what appears to be a beam coming down to the ground...This is unreal!\", Halt says. Several of the other men express their amazement at the lights and their strange behavior.</p><p>One popular suggestion from sceptics to debunk what is captured on this tape is that the men were observing light from the nearby Orfordness lighthouse, but there are some serious issues with this theory. The most obvious is that the lighthouse predates the then 38-year-old military bases, yet none of the thousands of men and women who had served at the bases during that time had ever mistaken the lighthouse for a UFO before. </p><p>Indeed, since these were US Air Force bases with military aircraft coming in and out multiple times a day, it seems somewhat unlikely that trained airmen would make such an elementary mistake. A further problem is that the beam from Orfordness is deliberately dimmed when shining inland by a blocking plate fitted around the lens. A lighthouse's beam also fails to match the actual nature of the observations the men are heard to be making.</p><blockquote><span>\"A lighthouse doesn’t move through the forest...change shape...doesn't send down beams of light from the sky\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Nick Pope rules out the lighthouse as the source of the phenomena, pointing out that it is either not visible or only a tiny pin-prick of light from the locations of the sightings. Halt himself also dismissed the lighthouse theory, stating - \"A lighthouse doesn’t move through the forest; the lighthouse doesn’t go up and down, it doesn’t explode, doesn’t change shape, size - doesn’t send down beams of light from the sky\".</p><p>Many UFO incidents are debunked by proving they either never occurred or that the witnesses were mistaken. The Halt tape is indisputable evidence that the incident did indeed occur and that several US airforce personnel experienced an unexplained encounter with a UFO. </p><p>Whether they were all mistaken is open to debate. But if they were, then they are joined by multiple others who witnessed something strange occurring around Rendlesham that Christmas.</p><h3>The Witnesses</h3><p>It's unknown exactly how many of the staff at the twin bases saw UFOs over Christmas 1980. There are at least a dozen named witnesses that have given verifiable, unambiguous on the record statements about what they saw over three separate nights, and authors like Georgina Bruni and Linda Moulton Howe have also tracked down and interviewed several more willing only to talk off the record.</p><p>However, the observations were not confined just to the US Air Force. Multiple civilians, such as local resident Gordon Levitt, also reported UFO phenomena over the same three nights. </p><p>Levitt lived in Sudbourne, a small village on the edge of Rendlesham, and reported seeing a UFO sometime on the night of the 26th December. In his police statement, Levitt says saw an unusual glowing object hovering over his garden at about twice the height of his house. Levitt then states the object moved away over towards the direction of the Rendlesham woods and RAF Woodbridge.</p><p>Clearly regardless of what Levitt saw, it is too much of a coincidence that he made this sighting during the same period as the phenomena at Woodbridge and Bentwaters. Levitt's sighting cannot be dismissed as bandwagon jumping as he reported it contemporaneous and independently to the police.</p><p>More local residents, amongst them Arthur Smekle and Roy and Marina Webb also saw multiple lights hovering over the forest on the 26th and 27th of December. Whether all of these observations can be dismissed with conventional explanations is open to question, but other evidence does tend to support that these witnesses saw something out of the ordinary.</p><p>Although sceptics correctly point out that there is no official documentary evidence that incongruous objects were tracked on nearby radar stations during the sightings, there is some reason to suspect otherwise.</p><h3>Bogeys</h3><p>Some of the military witnesses, such as Jim Penniston and Fred Buran, had already stated they heard over their radios that radar stations had tracked an uncorrelated target, or 'bogey' on radar. In her book You Can't Tell the People, author Georgina Bruni found former radar operator from RAF Watton who claimed that a strange object had been tracked in the Rendlesham area on the night of the first sightings.</p><p>More recently, two USAF air traffic controllers at Bentwaters have come forward with similar accounts. James H. Carey and Ivan R. Barker now both admit they had tracked an object moving at impossible speeds on their radar scopes, \"What impressed me most was the speed this thing had. I have never seen anything so fast in my life! It was zoom, gone!\", Barker told UFO researcher Robert Hastings. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/bentwaters-tower.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Unusual objects were tracked on radar at Bentwaters (credit: Juan Jimenez)</div></figcaption></figure><p>\"It covered 120-miles in approximately eight to twelve seconds. In the 15 years I was an air traffic controller, I'd never seen anything travel across the scope that fast.\", Carrey affirmed. These impossible speeds, in the many thousands of miles per hour, match almost all of the eye witness statements who observed the objects in the Rendlesham woods.</p><p>The MoD's recently released UFO files do demonstrate that they sought to corroborate the radar readings, but were hampered by the fact records had been destroyed and some of the cameras used to record the radar readings were not working during the days in question.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Mistaken Flying Objects</h3><p>Most UFOlogists acknowledge that the vast majority of reported sightings have conventional explanations. BUFORA, the British UFO Research Association analyse over 400 sightings every year and find approximately 95% of them can be explained as natural phenomena such as planets, stars or meteors, conventional aircraft, wildlife or other unusual atmospheric lighting effects.</p><p>Numerous sceptics have attempted to fit the Rendlesham Forest incident into the category of mistaken identity. The most popular hypothesis is that the sightings were due to the nearby Orfordness lighthouse. Whilst this explanation does not adequately fit most of the observations, there is a very telling correlation between the lighthouse's beam rotation and the Halt tape.</p><p>The lighthouse, built in 1793, makes one full rotation every fifteen seconds and flashes once every five seconds. When this five-second flashing interval is overlaid over Colonel Halt's audio tape it does seem to match the occasions Halt observes a flashing light very closely. Could Halt simply be mistaking the lighthouse for something more unearthly?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/kosmos.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Were the sightings caused by the burning up of the Russian Kosmos satellite?</div></figcaption></figure><p>It's also notable that the period of 25-26th December coincided with a confluence of unusual atmospheric phenomena. Shortly before the first cluster of sightings at Rendlesham, a Russian Kosmos 749 satellite burnt up over Western Europe and was widely reported as a UFO by multiple civilians.</p><p>Another rare event, the burning up of a meteor in the atmosphere, occurred in the early hours of the 26th of December. This meteor produced an unusually bright fireball and was visible throughout South East England.</p><p>There are pros and cons to these alternative possibilities. It's certainly a striking coincidence that the period of the observed UFO activity corresponded in time and location with at least three viable sources of  false positives - the Russian rocket, the meteor and the lighthouse. </p><p>This clearly cannot be overlooked and must surely account for at least some of the lights people claimed to have seen during that Christmas weekend. If these mistaken sightings could be eliminated from the list of observed UFOs at Rendlesham then the incident might start to look less impressive.</p><p>However, the rocket and the meteor are both short-lived events and don't adequately explain the nature of most of the observations nor the fact they were spread out over several hours over three separate nights. Likewise, the lighthouse cannot account for the majority of the sightings as it simply was not visible in the locations they were made.</p><h3>Science Fiction</h3><p>One of the most consistent characteristics of famous UFO cases is how evidence and testimony tend to evolve and become more sensational over time, usually to the detriment of the credibility of the case in question.</p><p>A notable example is Roswell. Ever since the famous 1947 case was rediscovered in the 1970s and 80s a whole series of dubious new claims about reverse engineered alien technology and even a filmed alien autopsy have come to light. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/roswell.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Famous UFO cases have attracted increasingly sensational claims - like the Roswell autopsy</div></figcaption></figure><p>With an endless production line of trashy TV documentaries to gobble up such material, a feedback loop of ever more sensational claims has plagued many high-profile UFO cases.</p><p>The Rendelsham Forest Incident has its fair share of sensational latter day embellishments like this. Although never mentioned in any of the original contemporary documents, airmen Larry Warren has emerged as a prominent and controversial Rendlesham witness in recent years.</p><p>Warren says he was present on the third night during Colonel Halt's investigation in Rendlesham Woods. His testimony differs radically from the acknowledged core witnesses like Halt in that he claims he saw the investigation party conversing with actual alien beings at the crash site. Warren also says he was brain-washed by men in black style interrogators in an underground facility at the base.</p><p>Warren's statements have caused a great deal of resentment amongst the core witnesses. Not only do they not match anybody else's recollections of what occurred, they tend to make the whole event look ridiculous and unbelievable. Records show Warren did serve at Bentwaters, but Halt, Monroe Nevel, Sgt Bustinza and others have stated that they do not recall him ever been present during any of the events of that night.</p><p>Those who know Larry Warren think he is a sincere individual who has been greatly traumatised by his perceived experiences. It's possible his story of been brainwashed may have some truth to it and he was somehow planted with false memories to undermine the credibility of the otherwise credible case.</p><p>Some of the acknowledged core witnesses have also heavily embellished their stories in recent years. Jim Penniston now says he spent 45 minutes examining the craft he observed in the first night, noting symbols on its body. He also says he touched the skin of the craft and received a telepathic message in binary code. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion/symbols.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The glyphs Penniston says he drew during the encounter</div></figcaption></figure><p>There is no reference to any of this in Penniston's original witness statements. Nor is there anything remotely resembling this version of  events in his radio communications with his commanders at the base.</p><p>Penniston has also produced some impressive looking documentary evidence in recent years, such as what he says is his police notebook from the night. The notebook has been covered in television specials and appears to show the notes he made describing the craft as well as drawings of the hieroglyphic-like symbols he says adorned it.</p><p>However, John Burroughs says he does not remember Penniston making any notes during the entire period they observed the object. Burroughs also says Penniston did not spend any deal of time examining the craft. The time and date shown in the notebook also does not correspond with the actual time and date of the incident as recorded in the contemporary documents.</p><p>Penniston's notebook is incredible and if genuine would be a pivotal piece of evidence in establishing the reality of the Rendlesham Forest case. Yet when interviewed for the 1994 Strange But True ITV special on the incident, he makes no mention of the notebook at all.</p><p>Penniston's now famous sketches of the triangular craft he says he saw in the woods also differs from the sketch of a rectangular object he made for Fred Buran just hours after the event in 1980.</p><p>Noted debunker of UFOs and the paranormal Dr David Clarke contacted Colonel Ted Conrad in 2010. Conrad was the commander of the twin bases and Charles Halt was his deputy. Conrad was present at the base on all through Christmas and believes the only occasion anything unusual occurred was the first night when lights were observed in the woods.</p><p>Conrad was in radio communications with the search party on the third night when Halt made his famous tape. He says he and the rest of the Christmas awards reception at RAF Woodbridge went outside to try and see the lights Halt was describing over the radio but saw absolutely nothing unusual all night.</p><p>If Colonel Conrad is telling the truth, then it does tend to suggest Halt and his men may simply have been misinterpreting a mundane phenomena such as a lighthouse beam as something more spectacular than it was.</p><p>However, even if he is not attempting to deliberately downplay the events, there appears to be little reason to favour Conrad's account, made from memory some 30 years after the incident, over the live recording of the men actually experiencing the events in question.</p><p>UFO cases are usually contentious. Advocates, certain there is a widespread government cover-up of the truth, tend to disbelieve anything coming from what they deem as establishment sources. Sceptics meanwhile, often overreach in their absolute determination to debunk controversial events.</p><p>As the inexhaustible appetite for alien and UFO related material grows on television, Rendlesham has become a popular topic for numerous documentaries in recent years. With this, there has been a troublesome escalation in the outlandishness of the retellings of the events of that Christmas in 1980.</p><p>Despite this, the hard evidence from the time remains unimpeached. Whatever stories are now been told, something very real happened in the woods at Rendlesham that, as the MoD files themselves now conclude, remains 'unexplained'.</p>","tile":"rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion","path":"rendlesham-forest-ufo-the-christmas-invasion","date":"2017-03-19T14:07:37.000Z","formatteddate":"Mar 19, 2017","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Rendlesham Forest UFO","subheadline":"The Christmas <span>Invasion</span>","snippet":"Did dozens of military personnel at RAF Bentwaters encounter an alien spacecraft over Christmas 1980?","tags":["ufo","aliens","rendelsham","flying saucer","raf","usaf","conspiracy","cover-up","nasa","roswell","cia","men in black","unexplained","weird"],"title":"Rendlesham Forest UFO - The Christmas Invasion","tileheadline":"The Christmas Invasion"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/first-folio.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">An original first folio of Shakespeare's plays published in 1623</div></figcaption></figure><p>The American author Henry James once said, \"I am haunted by the conviction that the divine William is the biggest and most successful fraud ever practiced on a patient world.\"</p><p>The William that Henry James is referring to is William Shakespeare, widely regarded the English language's greatest ever writer.

James' doubts, also shared by notable figures like Mark Twain, Sigmund Freud and Sir John Gielgud, are based on a strange mystery at the heart of one of history's most famous men.</p><p>Whilst William Shakespeare's works have inspired countless other writers, his own life is a blank sheet of paper. Most of what we know of him is in his guise as a minor businessman in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon in the English Midlands, where he was generally known as William Shakspere.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/shakespeare-house-stratford.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The house in Stratford Shakespeare was supposedly born</div></figcaption></figure><p>As William Shakespeare the famous writer of Elizabethan London, he is an elusive and ghostly figure, a puzzling conundrum whose biography appears wrought with contradictions and frustrating gaps. There is no record, for instance, of anybody claiming to personally know this Shakespeare during his lifetime, despite his fame and renown.</p><p>Perhaps odder still, nobody who knows Shakspere the provincial businessman from Stratford seems to have been aware that he was a famous writer. Everywhere in the biography of the author we are confronted with this dichotomy between what appears to be two very different Shakespeares.</p><p>The Stratford Shakspere, by all accounts we have, is a small and mean-spirited man. He is constantly in court over minor legal wranglings. He is a moneylender and serial tax-dodger. He hoards grain during a famine. He abandons his own young children and cruelly leaves his wife only his second-best bed in his will.</p><p>In contrast, the London Shakespeare is a man of grand ideas and imagination, a man who tackles the big universal themes with a breathtaking insight and empathy, a man with a profound and enduring appreciation for both the best and worst of the human condition. It is difficult to reconcile this great Shakespeare with the petty-minded businessman from Stratford.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/globe-theatre-performance.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">One of Shakespeare's great works performed at the restored Globe Theatre</div></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many great artists are deeply flawed people; Carraviagio was a murderer and Wagner an anti-Semite, but there are reasons beyond this schizophrenic character sketch to suspect there is something very wrong with the biography of William Shakespeare.</p><p>How do we explain the records from 1597 of the London Shakespeare living in a one room hovel and being pursued for a debt of five shillings, whilst at the same time in Stratford he is a wealthy businessman who lends money and buys the town's second biggest house? Are these two different men?</p><p>Over 70 documents survive that detail the life of the Stratford Shakspere, not a single one makes any mention that he is England's greatest playwright. Indeed, Shakespeare himself never mentions he is a playwright, and neither does his family or anybody who knows them.</p><p>His will reveals nothing that might hint he was one of history's most erudite and widely read writers, no books, manuscripts or even a bookshelf.  How could this wealthy man whose works were based on a huge range of sources in multiple languages own not a single book? Even stranger, Shakespeare wrote close to a million words in his own hand but not a single scrap of any of it survives.</p><p>Shakespeare's vast vocabulary and mastery of a wide range of esoteric subjects are also a difficulty for the official biography.  Scholars tell us he probably attended the local grammar school from seven to thirteen. The standard curriculum would have been in latin and consisted of rote learning of the classics, arithmetic, logic, and rhetoric.</p><p>However, the Shakespeare of the plays displays an extensive knowledge of the law, philosophy, ancient and modern history, astronomy, art, music, medicine, horticulture, heraldry, even military and naval terminology and tactics. He also has an apparently insider understanding of English, French and Italian court life, the vicissitudes of Tudor-era politics and the etiquettes and pastimes of the nobility.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/shakespeare-chandos-portrait-unknown.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Portrait of Shakespeare by unknown artist</div></figcaption></figure><p>Shakespeare's English vocabulary is huge and he contributes hundreds of new words and phrases to our language - \"All our yesterdays\", \"brave new world\" and \"in my heart of hearts\" amongst them. And his skill with language was not confined to English, many of his plays are based on Greek, French and Italian sources, often untranslated into English at the time.</p><p>How could a provincial grammar school boy have gained this impressive body of knowledge without ever having attended university or even traveled abroad? Historians tell us the disconnect between the biography and the works is an inevitable consequence of Shakespeare living in an era where far less was written down, and much that was is lost. These gaps have to be filled in with intelligent, contextual guesswork, they argue.</p><p>But if we strip away these centuries of historical and culture assumptions, it does seem hard to avoid the conclusion that the two Shakespeares are not facets of the same man but, in fact, two entirely different men. Shakespeare's biography, already heavily padded out with supposition, would become fiction.</p><p>Whilst some teasing suggestions that the plays were written by someone else can be found as early as Shakespeares own lifetime, the case for alternative authors really kicked off during the Victorian era. Over 80 possible candidates have been suggested since then, ranging from Sir Francis Drake to Miguel de Cervantes and even Queen Elizebeth.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/queen-elizebeth.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Queen Elizabeth is among more than 80 suggested canidates to be the author of Shakespeare's plays</div></figcaption></figure><p>American writer Samuel Clemens knew something about pseudonyms. Famously working under the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens wrote classic works such as Huckleberry Finn, often described as the 'Great American Novel'. He came out as a Shakespeare skeptic in typically witty and satirical fashion in Is Shakespeare Dead? published in 1909.</p><p>Echoing the many mysteries of Shakespeare's life, Twain wrote - \"Shall I set down the rest of the great Conjecture which constitute the Giant Biography of William Shakespeare? It would strain the Unabridged Dictionary to hold them. He is a brontosaur: nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster.\"</p><blockquote><span>\"He is a brontosaur: nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Twain himself favored Francis Bacon as the true author, but of the many candidates suggested, the most serious study has revolved around fellow Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlow and the aristocratic Sir Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford.</p><p>The anti-Stratfordians, as Shakespeare authorship skeptics are collectively known, have produced compelling cases for both men, whereas the traditional Shakespeare scholars have countered with seemingly fatal flaws in their arguments. Who is right?</p><p>Marlowe was a brilliant poet and playwright in his own right, predating Shakespeare but greatly influential upon him. His mercurial talent, along with his university education has made him many authors favored alternative candidate. However, his apparent death in a barroom fight in 1593, shortly before Shakespeare the author makes his first appearance, has led most mainstream scholars to dismiss the possibility.</p><p>Beginning in the 1920s, Essex peer Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, has emerged as the single most popular alternative candidate to be the true Shakespeare. De Vere was widely recognized as a brilliant, if volatile man, who had a classical education, possessed an intimate knowledge of the royal court and traveled extensively in France and Italy.</p><p>Critics of the Oxford theory argue that De Vere died in 1604, before some of Shakespeare's plays were supposed to be written. He also published some poems under his own name which they say are not as accomplished as the works attributed to Shakespeare.</p><p>Whilst the latter point is clearly subjective, nobody could claim De Vere was able to write plays from the grave. Did this rule the Earl out as the man behind the pseudonym? Oxfordians counter that many of Shakespeare's own plays, like Coriolanus and As You Like it, were unknown until years after his death.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/edward-de-vere-1575.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was the Earl of Oxford the author of Shakespeare's plays?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Both sides do agree on one thing, writing plays could be a risky business in the late 16th century. The often bawdy theatres were exiled to the darker corners of London for fear of corrupting decent folk, and censorship for profanity and heresy were rigorously enforced by the authorities. With paranoia about the anti-reformation rife, percieved pro-catholic sentiments were often viciously suppressed. The complex world of Elizabethan royal politics also provided plenty of traps for unwary writers to fall into.</p><p>These dangers were very real. Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe were tortured and persecuted for heresy, the latter possibly even murdered. Shakespeare's contemporaries like Ben Johnson and Thomas Nash were both amongst several playwrights imprisoned for writing material that displeased Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>It's plausible therefore that an aristocrat like De Vere, mindful of his political status within the Royal Court, or a bohemian free thinker like Marlowe wishing to avoid persecution, may have wanted to write their works from the safety of the shadows, using the then common Elizabethan affectation of a pseudonym.</p><p>The possibility would explain the many strange contradictions in Shakespeare's life. If the London Shakespeare was merely a mask behind which another writer hid then we could perhaps begin to add more bones to Mark Twain's metaphorical brontosaurus, and finally understand who this great writer really was.</p><p>Was 'William Shakespeare' a pseudonym for another writer?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>A Comedy of Errors</h3><p>The problems with Shakespeare's biography begin at birth, sometime in mid-April 1564, to John Shakspere, a local glovemaker and tradesman. The birth is registered in the Stratford Parish baptismal register on April 26th as William, son of John Shakspere.</p><p>Whilst it is often pointed out that spelling of names varied during Tudor times, Shakspere is what is used at young William's birth and also what is signed on his will 52 years later. In between he consistently uses Shakspere during his life in Stratford with only occasional minor variations.</p><p>It is safe, therefore to say Shakspere was what he regarded as his own name. By contrast, Shakespeare is what is used, with some minor variations, consistently during his time as a playwright in London. The most frequent variation during this time is Shake-speare, which is used exclusively in printed form and appears on close to half of his plays.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/stratford-grammar-school.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Scholars say Shakespeare probably attended the Stratford grammar school</div></figcaption></figure><p>With a complete lack of documentary evidence about his early childhood, historians tell us at the age of seven the young glovemaker's son was enrolled into the local grammar school. This is the cornerstone of the Shakespeare of biography as it is during his six years at the Stratford Grammar school that Shakespeare scholars tell us the budding author must have gained the bedrock of education he needed to become the world's greatest playwright.</p><p>The problem with the scenario is there is absolutely no evidence to suggest Shakespeare ever attended the Stratford Grammar school, it's a supposition driven by circular reasoning - Shakespeare was amazingly educated so he must have attended school. But not only is there no documentary evidence (scholars say records have not survived) that Shakespeare ever received any kind of education, the reality of life for a tradesman's son dictates against it.</p><p>Shakespeare's father and family were all illiterate. John Shakspere was a glovemaker, farmer, wool dealer and tanner who also held various posts in the local community such as alderman, burgess and town bailiff. Some records indicate he occasionally indulged in usury. There is no evidence this tradesman valued education or sent any of his other children to school.</p><p>Indeed, in the hard economic times of Tudor England, would John Shakespeare have elected to send his son to a grammar school six days a week rather than train him up in one of his trades so he could contribute to the family finances?</p><p>Shakespeare is now regarded as Stratford's most famous son, and his fame throughout the world generates a great deal of tourist income for the area. However, during his lifetime, and in the years that followed his death, nobody in Stratford appeared to have the slightest idea Shakespeare was an author at all, let alone one of London's most successful and lauded.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/camden-britannia.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Shakespeare is conspiciously not mentioned in Camden's Britannia</div></figcaption></figure><p>As early as 1593, Shakespeare has become a bestselling writer; his long narrative poem Venus and Adonis was the most successful of the whole decade. Shakespeare's status and reputation continued to grow with the production of further poems and dozens of successful plays over the next twenty years.</p><p>There is not a single extant record of anybody in Stratford acknowledging this. Not Shakespeare's own family or even Shakespeare himself ever make any reference to his occupation as an author. It doesn't appear to have become a local legend of the Stratford boy made good, as is common in countless other small towns that have produced successful luminaries.</p><p>Shakespeare scholars say that his reputation as an author would have been known in Stratford, but that most people were illiterate or had no reason to write it down. If they did, the documents simply don't survive, like many records from the era.</p><p>The sounds like a reasonable explanation on the face of it. But what do we make of William Camden, one of Tudor England's most reputable historians, who wrote about Stratford and its famous men in his popular English history volume Brittania in 1607 and failed to mention Shakespeare at all?</p><p>Camden was certainly aware of the great author - in 1605, he included him in a list of who he regarded as England's finest poets. He almost certainly knew he was from Stratford too, in 1602 he had been involved in a dispute with John Shakespeare of Stratford, Shakespeare's father, over his application for a coat of arms.</p><p>None of Shakespeare's own contemporaries, like fellow Midlands poet and dramatist Michael Drayton, ever make any mention of Shakespeare in connection with Stratford. A friend of Drayton, amateur poet Thomas Greene even lived in Shakespeare's house in 1609 and mentions 'Shakspere' in his diary but never once refers to him as an author, despite Greene's own literary connections.</p><p>Dr. John Hall was a prominent Stratford physician who treated many famous and notable men during his 30 years of practice. Hall kept detailed records of his patients with the intent of publishing a casebook in his retirement. Evident in the surviving notebooks are Hall's fascination with the educational and literary achievements of the men he treats.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/stratford-monument.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Stratford monument was changed long after Shakespeare's death to depict him as an author</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hall points to works of poet Michael Drayton and dictionary compiler Francis Holyoak, but makes no mention of famous Stratford author William Shakespeare. What's so astonishing about this omission is that Hall was married to Shakespeare's own daughter Susanna and lived nearby to him for over 10 years.</p><p>Dr. Hall must surely have treated Shakespeare during his years of practice, he noted treating Susanna, so the oversight appears inexplicable. Again, for this to make sense, we must propose that Hall did in fact write about Shakespeare but that the records have simply vanished into shadows of history like so many others.</p><p>The single most important document regarding Shakespeare's life that does survive is his detailed will of 1616. This will has long puzzled scholars due to its total lack of any reference to the fact the deceased man was an author or any other clue by which we might infer he was.</p><p>Amongst Shakespeare's many belongings listed in the will, no mention is made of anything relating to his writing - no quartos of his plays, no manuscripts, no notebooks, no quills, not even any paper.  Could a man who spent twenty years pouring his soul into plays not own a single copy of them? Or any other kind of art works, paintings, musical instruments, that might indicate he was a man of great culture?</p><p>Just as odd is the lack of books in Shakespeare's will. The scope of learning, knowledge of history and historical characters and familiarity with source works in multiple languages clearly demonstrated in Shakespeare's plays necessitate him owning many books. These were valuable objects at the time, yet Shakespeare makes no mention of a single volume in his will, nor even chests or bookshelves where they may have been stored.</p><p>Shakespeare scholars like to counter this inconvenient fact by saying it was not the custom at the time to leave books in your will. However, this is directly contradicted by Dr. Hall, Shakespeare's own son-in-law, who left a library of books and manuscripts in his will. Contemporary playwright Ben Jonson likewise left books in his will.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/shakespears-will.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Shakespeare's will contains no mention that the dead man was an author</div></figcaption></figure><p>Shakespeare skeptics also point out that it wasn't until years after the Stratford Shakspere's death that anybody connected him to the author Shakespeare. The first folio of his plays printed in 1623, seven years after the Stratford man's death, makes two separate references, one to Stratford and one to Avon.</p><p>However, both these pieces of evidence are somewhat flimsy. Avon is a common place name in England and Stratford is also an area in London. No other references to the author Shakespeare in relation to Stratford upon Avon have ever been found before this, making the connection entirely posthumous.</p><p>The bust of Shakespeare at his tomb in Stratford depicting him as an author is also not contemporary to his death.  It was altered long after to show him holding a quill; the original monument actually showed him with his hands on a bag of grain and gave no hint that he was a writer at all.</p><p>This Stratford Shakespeare was known to nobody as an author, had no kind of cultural life, did not own any of his own poems or plays, or any other kind of art works or books. He never attended university and evidence he ever went to school is circumstantial at best. Anything connecting the author Shakespeare to Stratford is posthumous and weak.</p><p>The only really solid facts that remain about the man from Stratford are from his business dealings, which reveal a somewhat unedifying picture of a tight-fisted, money-grubbing parochial businessman with no evident love of culture at all. He doesn't look a good fit as the author of the dazzlingly erotic Venus and Adonis, the tragic romance of Romeo and Juliet or the powerful exploration of grief and mortality of Hamlet.</p><p>The possibility then, that this seemingly piddling figure did not write the great words attributed to him is obvious. But it is not the only reason to believe the name Shakespeare may have hidden another author.</p><h3>A Rose by Any Other Name</h3><p>Whilst most scholars scoff at the idea that Shakespeare was a pseudonym, they do acknowledge that he was credited as the author of dozens of plays during the 17th century that he did not write. With no copyright protection, unscrupulous publishers were able to cash in on Shakespeare's reputation and erroneously attribute to him plays such as Mucedorus, The Puritan and The Merry Devil of Edmonton.</p><p>All of these plays were credited to Shakespeare after his death and probably have nothing to do with him. But other titles are more problematic. The Life of Sir John Oldcastle, A Yorkshire Tragedie and The London Prodigal were published under Shakespeare's name, but not written by him, during his own lifetime. The latter two were even staged by his own theatre company the King's Men.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/yorkshire-tragedie.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Plays like A Yorkshire Tragedie were published under Shakespeare's name but were not written by him</div></figcaption></figure><p>With this in mind, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the 'real' Shakespeare allowed other writers to publish works under his name on  two occasions that we know of. Shakespeare was, therefore, a pseudonym at least some of the time.</p><p>According to Taylor and Mosher's Biographical History of Anonyma and Pseudonyma (1951), this is not to be unexpected - \"In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Golden Age of pseudonyms, almost every writer used a pseudonym at some time or other during his career.\"</p><p>Not only were pseudonyms common in Elizabethan times, the use of a hyphen in the name, like Martin Mar-prelate, Cutherbert Curry-knave and Tom Tell-truth, was a particularly common form. This same verb-noun penname style, 'Shake-Speare' in this case, is used on close to half of the plays the author is credited with during his early career.</p><p>If, as Shakespeare scholars like to tell us, this is not a pseudonym, then it is one of history's most amazing coincidences, as 'Shake-Speare' just happens to make a phenomenally apt pseudonym for a writer.</p><p>The writer of the plays, whoever he was, demonstrated a thorough knowledge of ancient myth and legend, and would therefore be aware of the goddess Pallas Athena, in Greek myth born from the head of Zeus 'shaking a spear'. Most depictions of Pallas Athena, also known as Minerva, show her holding this spear.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/athena-with-spear.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Athena was usualy depicted holding a spear</div></figcaption></figure><p>That this spear shaking goddess was also associated with knowledge, wisdom, and the arts, could hardly be more appropriate. She was even specifically identified with playwrights by satirist Stephen Gosson in 1582, describing how the Romans would dedicate their plays to the gods, \"the penning to Minerva\".</p><p>These obvious parallels were not lost on contemporary authors, John Vicars described Shakespeare as he \"who takes his name from the shaking and spear\". Even Ben Jonson, in his introduction to the first folio in 1623, strongly makes the hint about spear shaking when he writes - \"In his well torned and true filed lines, In each of which he seems to shake a lance\".</p><blockquote><span>\"In his well torned and true filed lines, In each of which he seems to shake a lance\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Was it really a coincidence that this mysterious author, of whom we know so little, was often credited as the hyphenated Shake-Speare, a name that echoed a spear shaking goddess associated with the arts and playwrights? Could it be the real author of the plays deliberately choose the name Shakespeare as a playful allusion to he fact it was a literary pseudonym?</p><p>Some contemporary authors hinted of the deception. Joseph Hall and John Marston both refer to Shakespeare as Labeo, and poet John Davies called him 'our English Terence'. According to Suetonius, a Roman historian whose work was a popular reference source for Elizabethan authors, Labeo was a Roman nobleman who probably secretly wrote some of the work credited to the North African slave turned poet and playwright Terence.</p><p>The question is, if Shakespeare was our English Terence, who was his Labeo?</p><h3>The Case for Marlowe</h3><p>Before Shakespeare there was Marlowe. Although the two men were born in 1564, Marlowe's talent was far more precocious than Shakespeare's. Successful plays such as Tamburlaine (1587), The Jew of Malta (1589) and Dr. Faustus (1589), indeed all of Marlowe's known canon, predate Shakespeare's first published work, the poem Venus and Adonis in 1593.</p><p>Marlowe's work was extremely popular and influential in its time, and all mainstream scholars acknowledge his significant impact on Shakespeare. He pioneered the use of blank verse so evident in Shakespeare's plays, and the latter often borrows wholesale many of Marlowe's ideas, characters, words, and phrases. It's long been speculated early Shakespeare plays like Henry VI may even have been collaborations with Marlowe.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/christopher-marlowe.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A portrait thought to be of Christopher Marlowe</div></figcaption></figure><p>Marlowe proponents, or Marlovians as they are known, go much further than this and maintain their candidate was the main author of all of Shakespeare's work. Their argument centers not just on the acknowledged stylistic similarities, but the biography of Marlowe himself.</p><p>In contrast to Shakespeare, Marlowe had an excellent education, earning a masters degree at Cambridge. He was fluent in several languages and widely traveled. He was acquainted with many members of the aristocracy. He even had exotic life experiences; it is now known Marlowe was probably working periodically as a spy for the British government, operating in France, Italy and Spain.</p><p>Marlowe clearly had friends in high places, his literary patron was Sir Thomas Walsingham, courtier to Queen Elizabeth and brother of Marlowe's spymaster and head of the Secret Service Sir Francis Walsingham. He was also a member of the so-called university wits, a group of talented university educated poets and playwrights that included figures like Thomas Nash and George Peele.</p><p>In many ways, Marlowe is the best candidate to be the true Shakespeare out of all of those proposed over the years, even the Stratford man. He is the only serious alternative who was an acknowledged great writer in his own right, a man who pioneered many of the innovations Shakespeare would later use. His education, life experiences, friends and cultural life also look a perfect fit for the writer of the plays.</p><p>The problem, of course, is what happened in May 1593, when Marlowe's glittering career was cut tragically short by a brutal fight in a tavern in Deptford. History tells us the 29-year-old writer was killed, stabbed in the eye, after getting into a fight with three other men over a bar bill. Since this was before Shakespeare's work ever appeared in print, how could Marlowe be the true author of the plays?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/sir-francis-walsingham.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Marlowe was a spy for Sir Francis Walsingham's Secret Service</div></figcaption></figure><p>This seemingly fatal flaw is an integral part of the Marlovian's theory. Marlowe was no ordinary Elizabethan author, he was a spy and had rich and powerful benefactors. They say Marlowe had gotten himself into big trouble with the authorities over heresy charges and his friends helped him evade punishment by staging his death and smuggling him out of the country to Italy.</p><p>It wouldn't be the first time Marlowe had been mysteriously protected from the consequences of his actions. In 1587, Cambridge University refused to award him his masters degree for both lack of attendance and rumors he was involved with Catholic sedition in France. The privy council, including the Queen's chief advisor Lord Burghley, intervened, ordering Cambridge to award Marlowe the degree because of his \"faithful dealing\" and \"good service\" to the Queen.</p><p>In 1592, Marlowe was arrested in Holland on serious charges of counterfeiting. When shipped back to England for prosecution, Lord Burghley again stepped in and all the charges were dropped. Incidents like these have convinced many that Marlowe was not only a spy, but an important one, for Burghley and Walsingham's Secret Service.</p><p>Had his powerful protectors again swooped in in 1593 when Marlowe faced charges of heresy? What happened in the tavern in Deptford was  based on anecdote and rumor until 1923, when the previously lost coroner's report into Marlowe's death was found by American scholar J. Leslie Hotson.</p><p>All three of the men involved in the incident were in the employ of Walsingham, and the tavern in question was directly connected to Burghley. Was his apparent death actually Marlowe's last theatrical production under his own name, a ruse concocted with his fellow spies to aid his escape from the country?</p><p>From here Marlovians then contend their candidate continued to write poems and plays whilst in exile in Italy, sending them back to England under the pen name William Shakespeare. They point to the many Shakespeare plays set in Italy and the repeated theme of exile and false identity Shakespeare explores in many of his works.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/christopher-marlowe-rupert-everett.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Christopher Marlow as played by Rupert Everett in the film Shakespeare in Love</div></figcaption></figure><p>The date of Marlowe's death and the appearance of Shakespeare on the literary scene is also highly suggestive. Just thirteen days after Marlowe's supposed demise in Deptford, the long narrative poem Venus and Adonis first appears under the name William Shakespeare. For Marlovians, the timing and its stylistic similarities to Marlowe's earlier poem Hero and Leander, point to this been the first work under his new nom de plume of Shakespeare.</p><p>Of course, if Marlowe really did die in the tavern in Deptford, then he is not the author of Shakespeares plays. At this point, a mercurial Earl enter's stage left.</p><h3>The Case for De Vere</h3><p>Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford was a theatrical soul at heart. Born in 1550 and raised in Queen Elizabeth's court, his eventful and colorful life would have made a good Shakespeare play.</p><p>Indeed, many Oxfordians believe dramatic incidents from De Vere's life are directly fictionalized in some of Shakespeare plays, a sure sign, they claim, that Oxford was their true author.</p><p>As to be expected of a man born into the aristocracy, Oxford's education was far superior to that of the Stratford Shakspere. He was tutored by some of the finest men of the age, including mathematician and occultist John Dee, studied French, Latin and law and developed a keen interest in history, philosophy, and literature.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/william-cecil-lord-burghley.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Oxford was brought up in the Royal Court by Lord Burghley</div></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that De Vere studied law is of particular interest considering how steeped in legal terminology much of Shakespeare's writing is. Plays like Measure for Measure and the Merchant of Venice, as well as sonnets like Sonnet 46, contain complex extended legal metaphors that Oxfordians say could only come from the mind of a trained lawyer.</p><p>In terms of literary credentials to be the man behind Shakespeare's quill, Oxford does not seem to fair as well as Christopher Marlowe. Very little of the Earl's writing survives and what does are callow efforts that cannot be expected to compare to the mature writer of the plays.</p><p>However, anecdotally, at least, Oxford's had a reputation in the Royal Court as an excellent author. Francis Mere’s 1598 Palladis Tamia highly rates De Vere as a comic writer. Historian Henry Peacham, perhaps in the know, does not mention Shakespeare at all in 1622's The Compleat Gentleman, but praises Oxford as one of the leading poets of the era.</p><p>Oxford's family were also steeped in the theatre. His father had his own theatrical troupe called Oxford's Men, and Oxford himself was an important lifelong patron of the arts, including poets and writers, actors, musicians and acrobats. A group of actors sponsored by Oxford would continue to perform around the country as the Oxford Players for over twenty years.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/hamlet.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Oxford's life seem to mirror that of the fictional Hamlet</div></figcaption></figure><p>Shakespearean actors like Mark Rylance have commented that they feel the authorial voice that comes to them through the plays is that of someone with the theatre running through their blood, and Oxford certainly fits the bill on that front.</p><p>Whilst the historical photo-fit of Oxford may resemble the author of the plays, it's De Vere's very personal connection to many of the works of Shakespeare that Oxfordians believe is their strongest suit.</p><p>When Venus and Adonis, the first credited work of Shakespeare, appeared in 1593, it was dedicated to Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton. At the time, Oxford's daughter had just become engaged to Wriothesley. Another family member, Oxford's uncle Henry Howard, actually invented the sonnet form used in Shakespeare's 156 sonnets.</p><p>Many conventional Shakespeare scholars agree that the character of Polonius in Hamlet is a quite detailed parody of Queen Elizebeth's chief counsel Lord Burghley. Burghley was Oxford's father in law and guardian when he was growing up. Oxfordians contend much of Hamlet is the deeply autobiographic work of the Earl, so closely does it resemble his real life.</p><p>If Polonius is Burghley in the analogy, then Oxford himself is Hamlet. Like Hamlet was engaged to Polonius' daughter Ophelia, Oxford was engaged to Burghley's daughter Anne Cecil. Hamlet's best friend was Horatio, Oxford's his cousin Horatio De Vere.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/elizebathan-procession-london.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Earl of Oxford was brought up in the heart of Queen Elizebeth's court</div></figcaption></figure><p>Both Hamlet and Oxford are courtiers, athletes, scholars, and poets; both are patrons of acting companies. Hamlet is captured at sea by pirates and left naked on the shore, something which actually happened in real life to Oxford. In the play Hamlet reads a real book called De Consolatione, Oxford was behind the first English translation of the same book.</p><p>Hamlet is often called Shakespeare's greatest play. Did its power come from the fact its real author, Edward De Vere, was writing from his own personal experiences? Oxfordians think so, and say they have found many such personal parallels to his life in Shakespeare's other plays, poems, and sonnets.</p><p>Why did De Vere simply not publish these works under his own name? The theory goes that there was a convention against the aristocracy writing plays. Political sensitivities and Oxford's desire to maintain his position in court may have also spurred him to write under the Shakespeare pseudonym.</p><p>What of Oxford's death in 1604? Ten Shakspeare plays appear after this, but Oxfordians argue this is not the same kind of problem as Marlowe's premature death is for the Marlovians. The dating of many of the plays is extremely uncertain, often fit around the chronology of the Stratford Shakspere's life. Even the official dating has several plays not appearing until the first folio, seven years after Shakespeare's death.</p><p>Perhaps there is one final clinching argument for the Oxfordians. The Earl of Oxford was a champion jouster, winning many competitions throughout Europe. After winning one bout in 1578, writer Gabriel Harvey paid tribute to Oxford in front of the Royal Court, coining his nickname by referring to him as one whose \"vultus tela vibrat”, or whose \"countenance shakes speares.\"</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Love's Labour's Lost</h3><p>The suggestion that any author other than the Stratford Shakspere was the main writers of the plays is unequivocally rejected by all mainstream Shakespeare scholars. They cite a mass of historical, literary and contextual evidence to reject alternative candidates like Marlowe and Edward De Vere.</p><p>But perhaps the most straightforward objection is why any great writer would need to hide behind a pseudonym at all? Whoever wrote Shakspeare's plays, he dedicated 25 years of his life to writing close to a million words, some the most beautiful in the English language. All of this to hand the glory over to another?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/elliott-brown-shakespeare-statue.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Would the real author of the play's really hand the glory over to Shakespeare? (credit: Elliott Brown)</div></figcaption></figure><p>There would need to be a compelling reason for such a profoundly painful sacrifice. Oxfordians like to argue that there was an aristocratic convention against nobleman like the Earl of Oxford writing plays under their own name, but Shakespeare scholars reject this and point to the many poems and plays Oxford apparently did write without any fear of sanction.</p><p>Marlovians say their candidate had to fake his own death and continue to write under a nom-de-plume to avoid arrest and prosecution for heresy. However since the elaborate conspiracy theory around the faked death involved some of England's most powerful men, why did they not simply have the charges of heresy dropped instead, as they had done on previous occasions Marlowe had fallen foul of the law?</p><p>As for how Marlowe could have remained undetected in exile for more than two decades, it is a matter of speculation. It was much easier to disappear in Tudor times; there were no photographs, passports or mass media. But would a colorful, hellraising character like Marlowe really not have left his mark somewhere? Or have made a deathbed confession?</p><p>Even if Marlowe, or any other secret hand behind the Shakespeare oeuvre, could keep a secret, could everyone else? With dozens of playrights and hundreds of actors operating in London during Shakespeare's time, would there not be more gossip, more rumors, more outright accusations that Shakespeare was a fake?</p><h3>Methought I was enamored of an ass</h3><p>Whilst much doubt surrounds the Stratford Shakspere's life and his connection to the author William Shakespeare, we can still be reasonably certain he had real, documented links to both acting and the Globe Theatre.</p><p>In 1599, Shakespeare is listed amongst other actors of the Lord Chamberlain's men, including Richard Burbage, on a lease for the Globe theatre. Court records in 1615 also show Shakespeare was a shareholder at the Globe and Blackfriars theatres.</p><p>In 1595, an entry in the accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber reads - \"William Kempe, William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, servaunts to the Lord Chamberleyne, upon the Councille's warrant dated at Whitehall XVth Marcij 1594, for two severall comedies or enterludes shewed by them before her majestie in Christmas tyme laste\".</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/shakespeare-conspiracy-the-fraud-of-avon/globe-theatre.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Documents list Shakespeare as an actor and shareholder in the Globe Theatre</div></figcaption></figure><p>In 1603, Shakespeare appears, along with a list of other players including Burbage, on the cast list for Ben Jonson's play Sejanus His Fall.

Just how reliable is his story?</p><h3>Spinning a yarn</h3><p>Jim Templeton was already well known in Cumbria before his photo became a national sensation. A keen historian and amateur photographer, Jim’s archive of local photos was a well-used resource by the areas newspapers.</p><p>Just weeks before the appearance of the ‘spaceman’, Jim had tricked friends with a fake five-pound note he had made using his photographic skills.</p><p>Did Jim fake the spaceman picture for a joke? In 1997, photo-analyst Roger Green of Bradford University studied the image and concluded that it was “a composite made using some superimposition technique”.</p><p>Author Dr. David Clarke interviewed Templeton many times. He doesn’t believe Jim faked the photo. Clarke thinks his friends in the local photo lab may have mocked the photo up as a way of getting back at him for practical jokes he had played on them.</p><p>Even if the image was just a freak shot of his wife Annie accidentally walking into the top of the picture, could Jim have deliberately fanned the ‘spaceman’ angle for a joke?</p><p>Other details of his story suggest he was at the very least prone to telling tales.</p><p>The two unnamed government officials who escorted Jim back to Burgh Marsh are often compared in UFO circles to the famous ‘men in black’.

Something terrible was lurching out of the fog and attacking local residents.</p><p>An elderly lady visiting the cemetery at Clapham was one of the first to see the chilling figure. Clad in a dark cloak, with a hat pulled over its face, she saw it make an ungodly jump over a high fence and disappear into the darkness.</p><p>Around the same time, a young girl by the name of Mary Stevens reported an encounter with the same strange character.</p><p>Making a giant leap out of a dark alley, it launched a fearsome attack on the girl, ripping at her clothes with its cold, clammy claws. The girl screamed for help and the creature fled.</p><p>The next night, a similar figure jumped out at a coach causing it to crash. Several witnesses saw the figure escape the scene by bounding over a 9ft high wall, its high-pitched laughter disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Soon, news of the attacks would reach the authorities. Sir John Cowan, the Lord Major, received an anonymous letter alerting him to the spate of attacks. Cowan initially dismissed the letter as wild nonsense.</p><p>However, within weeks he was flooded with similar accounts of attacks all across London and was forced to call a public meeting to discuss the crime wave.</p><p>News had also started to reach the flourishing tabloid press. Whilst early accounts varied wildly, it was here that Jack’s appearance and modus operandi became fixed, and his famous name — ‘Spring Heeled Jack’ was first born.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"739\" height=\"1095\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london/one-penny-spring-heeled-jack-a-man-or-fiend.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A periodical from 1904 recounted stories about Jack</div></figcaption></figure><p>According to the papers, Jack had pointed ears and a hooked nose, fierce claws and glowing red eyes. Beneath a dark cloak, he wore a tight oilskin suit. Always present was his miraculous ability to jump great heights.</p><p>By the 1830s, taxation on paper and printing had been greatly reduced, leading to a boom of cheap popular printed media, newspapers and a kind of early graphic novel called the penny dreadful.</p><p>These publications were hungry for lurid tales of crime and horror and the stories of Spring Heeled Jack immediately caught their imagination.</p><p>It was in the penny dreadfuls that Jack became a kind of early Victorian supervillain, his abilities and appearance massively exaggerated. Now his leaps were over entire building; sometimes he could even fly. His eyes glowed red, and he could spit blue fire from his mouth.</p><p>Meanwhile, the real Spring Heeled Jack was about to make his most famous and well-documented attack.</p><p>In a well to do home in London’s east end in February 1838, teenager Jane Alsop answered the door to be greeted by a shadowy figure. “I’m a policeman. For Gods sake, bring me a light, for we have caught Spring Heeled Jack here in the lane!”</p><p>Fetching the man a candle, Jane was startled by his strange appearance. Suddenly he flung off his cloak and started to attack the girl. His eyes glowed red, and he spewed blue flames as he clawed at the girls clothes with his metal talons.</p><p>With the help of her sister, the girl eventually managed to free herself from Jacks’s grasp and retreated to the safety of the house.</p><p>Whether Jane had exaggerated the outlandish aspects of Jack’s appearance, perhaps influenced by press accounts, is lost to history. But the police and the magistrate treated her report as a real attack.</p><p>Indeed, despite the seeming supernatural qualities Jack possessed, John Cowan, the Lord Mayor and the Metropolitical police were certain the attacks were committed by a flesh and blood man.</p><p>There had been similar sightings in the weeks before the Alsop case and several culprits were suggested — a bricklayer called Payne was suspected, along with a carpenter called Millbank. However, no positive identifications were made.</p><p>One theory going round was that the attacks were committed by a bunch of decadent aristocrats for a wager. The idea that the debauched young aristocracy could be a menace to society was a popular one at the time, especially in the working class popular press.</p><p>The individual most often mentioned in the press, especially later in the 19th century, was the 3rd Marquis of Waterford, Henry de La Poer Beresford.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london/marquis-of-waterford-spring-heeled-jack.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was the Marquis of Waterford Spring Heeled Jack?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Beresford was popularly known as the ‘Mad Marquis’ for his outrageous drunken pranks and antics.

Soon after, the Marquis of Waterford’s name was first linked to the case.</p><p>It’s not hard to see why he had become a suspect. He was notorious in the late 1830s for his drunken vandalism, pranks and outrageous behaviour.</p><p>Many of his hellraising antics were widely reported in the press, especially the notorious incident in Melton Mowbray that gave rise to the phrase ‘painting the town red’.</p><p>After a day at the races, Waterford and his fox hunting friends vandalised the town centre with red paint during a drunken rampage.</p><p>The Marquis, a former boxer, was young and athletic at the time of the sightings and could have matched Jack’s less outlandish physical exploits. He was also said to have a particularly cruel streak.</p><p>It did not seem much of a stretch to suggest that he could also be behind the Spring Heeled Jack attacks, perhaps as an idle wager amongst the group.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london/marquis-of-waterford-vandalism.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Waterford’s vandalism and drunken pranks were notorious</div></figcaption></figure><p>In 1880, E.

However, the reliability of Haining’s evidence has been questioned by some historians.</p><p>Haining theorized that the Marquis had felt humiliated by bad experiences he had had with women and the police. Along with his rich companions, he dreamt up the idea of Spring Heeled Jack to get his revenge.</p><p>With the help of friends who had experience in mechanics, Waterford was able to construct special spring heeled boots to achieve Jack’s incredible leaping prowess.</p><p>According to Haining, to round off the horrifying effect, the Marquis even learnt fire-breathing!</p><h3>The timings</h3><p>One of the reasons Waterford’s name has cropped up as a suspect was the fact his presence in London coincided with the first Spring Heeled Jack assaults.</p><p>The Marquis of Waterford lived in the area of the first attacks in 1837 and 1838, and upon his departure from London in 1842, reports of further Jack sightings dried up.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"735\" height=\"1106\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london/one-penny-spring-heeled-jack-a-mystery-of-mysteries.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A typical Spring Heeled Jack attack as depicted in the penny dreadfuls</div></figcaption></figure><p>Waterford returned to Ireland with his new wife and reportedly turned his back on cruel jokes to live a respectable life, until his death in 1859.</p><p>Intermittent reports of further Spring Heeled Jack sightings continued after this. If Waterford was responsible for the early attacks, then, as Brewer suggested, these later cases were copy-cats.</p><h3>The W</h3><p>One further piece of evidence to suggest the Marquis of Waterford may have been the original Spring Heeled Jack was the reported similarity between a crest spotted on Jack’s chest with Waterford’s coat of arms.</p><p>One of Jack’s victims, a young servant boy in a South London household, escaped an encounter with the monster with no more than a fright.</p><p>He did, however, allegedly observe an elaborate embroided crest on the assailant’s costume, topped with a letter W.</p><p>Could the W have stood for Waterford? Perhaps the Marquis had appropriated an old piece of family garb, complete with crest, to complete his costume?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Fact and fiction</h3><p>The main issue with the identification of the Marquis of Waterford as Spring Heeled Jack is the lack of verifiable historical evidence to back it up.</p><p>Like much of the story, fact and fiction have merged into one over the course of countless retellings. By the end of the 19th century, outright fictions about Jack were regularly been reported as historical facts.</p><p>The penny dreadfuls, in particular, would gleefully exaggerate the real attacks and even invent entirely new ones. Many of the supposed supernatural attributes of Jack also originated with these publications.</p><p>According to some historians, many of the facts linking Waterford to Spring Heeled Jack were almost certainly based on later fictional embellishments.</p><p>The story of the servent boy observing the letter W on Jack’s costume is not present in any contemporary newspaper report. It probably originates in one of the countless later retellings that sought to link the crimes to Waterford.</p><p>Another frequently cited Spring Heeled Jack encounter also appears to be entirely mythical. A young girl called Polly Adams recalled a ‘devil like nobleman’ with bulging eyes assaulting her at Blackheath Fair.</p><p>Again no record of this attack appears in any contemporary sources. The purpose of this clearly fictional story becomes clear when the Marquis of Waterford’s physical appearance is taken into account.</p><p>The Irish aristocrat was said to have unusually protruding eyes, indicating the apocryphal Polly Adams attack was another scurrilous attempt to link the crimes to Waterford.</p>","tile":"spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london","path":"spring-heeled-jack-the-terror-of-london","date":"2019-11-23T13:41:39.572Z","formatteddate":"Nov 23, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Spring Heeled Jack","subheadline":"The Terror <span>of London</span>","snippet":"Was the legendary Spring Heeled Jack an Irish nobleman known as the Mad Marquis?","tags":["spring","heeled","Jack","London","Victorian","cryptid","cryptozoology","marquis","waterford","beresford","hoax","myth","crime","legend","monster","weird","paranormal"],"title":"Spring Heeled Jack - The Terror of London","tileheadline":"The Terror of London"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/gang-bank-job-film.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A still from the 2008 film The Bank Job which dramatizes the robbery</div></figcaption></figure><p>With the robbers broadcasting their crime live over the airwaves, it's a mystery why the police never caught the Baker Street gang red-handed. </p><p>The safety deposit raid in 1971 is one of the most baffling in British criminal history, and rumours that its true purpose has been covered up by the British establishment persist to this day.</p><p>The problem is they should never have gotten away with a penny.  In the early hours of Saturday 11th September 1971, as the robbers were tunneling into the safety deposit vault at Lloyds Bank on Baker Street, a nearby amateur radio ham was listening to their every word.</p><p>The gang were using walkie-talkies to communicate, and radio hobbyist Robert Rowlands had accidently tuned into their transmissions. Rowlands notified the police, who were slow to believe his claim that he had happened upon a genuine robbery in progress. Eventually persuaded, they set out on a frantic search of hundreds of London's banks in an attempt to thwart the raid.</p><p>They didn't succeed. Rowlands had informed the police that the range of the transmissions meant the robbers must be nearby - within about a mile of his Wimple Street flat. For reasons never adequately explained, they decided to spread the net out to a 10-mile radius instead, vastly expanding the number of banks they would have to search. With limited resources and the need to ask the permission of each bank to search it, they failed to stop the gang in time.</p><p>The raid at Baker Street branch of Lloyds bank was then Britain's biggest and most ambitious, the thieves crowbarring open 260 boxes and making away with an estimated £30m in today's money. It caused a seismic shockwave across the banking industry and panic amongst the rich and powerful clientele who had their most private, and possibly even illegal, valuables stored in the vaults.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/annotated-photo-robbery.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">An annotated police photo showing how the robbers tunneled into the bank</div></figcaption></figure><p>From the beginning, it was clear this was no ordinary heist. It was far more complex, elaborate and well planned than anything that had ever been seen in the country before. The gang had leased a leather goods shop two doors down from the bank and spent three months studiously digging a tunnel from the basement of the shop, beneath the neighbouring Chicken Inn and into the vault.</p><p>The robbery required a hitherto unseen level of patience and expertise from the thieves, utilizing then hard to obtain radio communications equipment, explosives, expensive digging machinery and even a thermal lance. It was a professional and carefully planned operation, but one that raised some nagging questions that have never been satisfactorily answered.</p><p>Because these robbers weren't the criminal mastermind their unbelievable heist made them appear. They were small time crooks, petty thieves and con men who had never done anything even remotely on the scale of the Baker Street job before. How had the gang managed to graduate to such big league criminality with such apparent ease?</p><p>Even the culprits knew what they had pulled off was impressive, writing 'Let's see how Sherlock Holmes solves this one' on the wall, a reference to the Conan-Doyle story The Red-headed League which involves the detective foiling a similar bank robbery. </p><p>The Metropolitan Police didn't need the world's greatest detective in the end, and at least some of the culprits were eventually caught. One of the gang - Desmond Wolfe, had made the elementary mistake of hiring the leather goods shop that served as their base under his own name.</p><p>Police eventually tracked down the other gang members from their associations with Wolfe.  Anthony Gavin, Thomas Stephens and Reginald Tucker were subsequently arrested, convicted and sentenced to 12 years in jail for their roles in the Baker Street robbery.</p><p>Unlike many other high-profile criminals, such as the men behind the Great Train Robbery, the gang have remained resolutely discrete over the years. Despite masterminding the most audacious crime in British criminal history, none of the men have ever talked. No big pay-days from the tabloids to tell their story, no lucrative book deals. Quietly released a few years later, they all disappeared into obscurity.</p><p>But it seemed none of the men were ever short of money. Nothing taken from the robbery - money, jewels or anything else, was ever recovered. Had the gang somehow managed to retrieve their booty after their release, right under the noses of the police? Or had they been bought off by somebody?</p><p>It was questions like his that began a series of rumours, some probably myths, others legitimate and troubling questions that remain unanswered. Was there more to this daring crime than met the eye? Did the British government even slap a gagging notice on the press to prevent them reporting the real truth behind the robbery?</p><p>Police always suspected that not only were there others involved but that there must have been a mastermind behind such a daring raid. Such was its expense and complexity it seems unlikely to have been hatched by such small time operators without the help from somebody. The question is who?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/the-bank-job-2008.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Royal scandal theory is depicted in the 2008 film The Bank Job</div></figcaption></figure><p>Speculation about who was really behind the raid has lead to some sensational theories. What if the real target of the robbers was not loot but something even more valuable?</p><p>After the raid, many of the clientele did not come forward to report what they had lost; safety deposit boxes were designed to be discrete and were often used to store sensitive items and documents that their owners would often rather not even admit existed. Was the target something so sensitive it could be used to blackmail one of the powerful clients?</p><p>The most famous version of this theory was turned into an entertaining film in 2008 called The Bank Job. Based loosely on the Baker Street robbery, it alleges that British intelligence had hired the gang to raid the safety deposit boxes at the bank to retrieve pornographic photographs of a prominent member of royalty. Although not named, rumors have circulated for decades that this royal was the Queen's sister Princess Margaret.</p><p>Margaret had already skirted dangerously close to scandal in the 60s and 70s. She was notorious for her louche lifestyle and association with several disreputable and criminal figures. It is highly probable MI5, the UK's internal intelligence service, was at least keeping tabs on Margaret. Was the robbery an operation to prevent a highly damaging Royal scandal becoming public? </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/princess-margaret-1965-eric-koch--anefo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Rumours circulated around Princess Margaret (credit: Eric Kock/Anefo)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Bank Job claims to be more than just speculation. Writers Dick Clement and Ian le Frenais say they based their script on inside information from a journalist who was involved with the story back in 1971. In the film an underworld figure named Michael X is storing sexual photographs of Margaret taken on her holiday home in Mustique in the Baker Street vault with the intention of using them to blackmail the British establishment into turning a blind eye to his criminal activities. </p><p>Did this explain how well funded the operation was? The way the police seemed to be reluctant to catch the gang? And the supposed D-notice placed on the press preventing them from reporting what really happened?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Scandal!</h3><p>Despite her immense privileges, Princess Margaret was a tragic figure. The Queen's younger sister would never become monarch herself and failed to carve any kind of meaningful role for herself in the Royal hierarchy.</p><p>Bereft of a sense of purpose, the young Princess would increasingly lose herself in a life of hedonism and become notorious for her drinking, partying and a succession of lovers. At her hideaway on the Carribean island of Mustique, Margaret would entertain a string of young men, society figures and even those from the criminal fraternity like infamous cockney gangster John Bindon.</p><p>Tales of Margaret's exploits on Mustique are legendary. On one occasion she photographed several of her male friends naked on the beach. Another time Bindon performed his famous party trick involving hanging 5 half pint glasses from his penis, much to Margaret's delight. Some biographers now believe Margaret even had an affair with Bindon, something he would occasionally brag about himself.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/notorious-picture-john-bindon-princess-margaret.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Princess Margaret was said to have had an affair with notorious gangster John Bindon</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the case, she had already compromised herself; a photograph of Margaret with the then wanted criminal Bindon was widely circulated in Fleet Street, although not actually printed by the press until many years later. Such a photograph would have been a scandal in itself, but did even more salacious pictures exist?</p><p>Considering what we already know about Princess Margaret, it's certainly plausible photographs extreme enough to be used for blackmail or cause a major public scandal may have existed. In The Bank Job, exactly such photographs are in the possession of an underworld figure named Michael X.</p><p>Real name Michael De Freteis, Michael X was a London gangster, drug dealer and slum landlord in the 1960s and 70s. X became a minor celebrity in the late 60s by setting up a London branch of the Black Power movement and was briefly feted in the press by such figures as John Lennon and Yoko Ono.</p><p>According to The Bank Job, Michael X kept compromising photographs of Margaret taken on Mustique in his safety deposit box at the Baker Street bank. He planned to use them as blackmail material to prevent prosecution for his criminal activities. Fearful of a major national scandal if they are made public, MI5 orders the raid to retrieve them.</p><p>Shortly after the robbery in 1971, Michael X was allowed to leave England for his native Trinidad, despite the fact he was due in court on charges of extortion. A few months later, the commune he started there burnt down in mysterious circumstances. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/michael-x.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Michael X as depicted in The Bank Job</div></figcaption></figure><p>The story had fatal consequences for Michael X. When police found the hacked bodies of two of its members buried in shallow graves on the property, he was charged with their murders and hung for the crime in 1975.</p><p>Although little or no hard evidence exists in the public domain for the scenario depicted in the Bank Job, the writers of the film - Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, say they had a deep throat style informant who was involved in the original investigation to confirm the events depicted in the film.</p><p>That informant was actually Evening Standard journalist George McIndoe, who claimed to have learnt about the salacious photographs after getting to know two members of the Baker Street gang in the 1970s. With none of the men themselves talking and Michael X dead, it's clearly hard to verify what McIndoe told the writers.</p><p>One curious piece of circumstantial evidence does exist, however. Micheal X's MI5 file is locked up until 2054, 83 years after the robbery and 79 years after his death. The secrecy over the file of an obscure London gangster seems unwarranted. Could it be there is something so explosive in those files that they might still be embarrassing decades after everyone involved is dead?</p><p>In later years, a far more sinister variation on the Royal scandal theory has emerged. Brian Reader, a gang member not captured by police in 1971, says the men found sickening images of child sex abuse involving prominent politicians in the safety deposit boxes.</p><p>The now elderly Reader made the claims at his trial for involvement in another famous robbery, the 2015 heist of the safety deposit boxes at London's Hatton Garden. He says the gang at Baker Street were so disgusted by the pictures they left them scattered out on the floor of the vault for the police to find.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/hatton-garden-roger-w-haworth.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">One of the Baker Street gang was also involved in the Hatton Garden heist (credit: Roger W Haworth)</div></figcaption></figure><p>If this is true, the resulting scandal would far eclipse even salacious pictures of a prominent royal. Allegations that there is a systematic cover-up of a child-sex ring at that highest level of British politics persists even today. If evidence for such a ring had been found scattered on the floor of a bank vault back in 1971, it would certainly have been concealed by the authorities.</p><p>The role of British intelligence in such a scenario could take two forms. The first is that the raid was a stunt orchestrated by them to provide blackmail opportunities against high-ranking politicians. More likely is that on discovering the material in the aftermath of the robbery, MI5 swooped in to aid the cover-up and ensure a scandal did not break that would potentially bring down the British government itself. </p><h3>A Blind Eye</h3><p>On the morning of Saturday 11th September 1971, the Metropolitan Police knew two solid facts about the bank robbery currently in progress somewhere in London. Firstly the culprits were attempting to tunnel their way inside a safety deposit vault, and secondly that that vault was located within a mile of the flat of CB radio ham Robert Rowlands.</p><p>If the police had used this information, they would almost certainly have caught the men before they even made it into the bank. Instead, they sent their men on a wild goose chase of more than 170 banks across ten miles of north-west London, massively decreasing the odds that they would find the correct location in time.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/robert-rowlands-radio-ham.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robert Rowlands gave the police all the information they needed to capture the robbers</div></figcaption></figure><p>Despite this, sometime on Sunday morning, police did search the Baker Street branch of Lloyds Bank. With the gang just a few feet away behind the 15-inch thick door of the vault, the bank was dismissed as the location of the robbery because there were no signs of a break-in.</p><p>Whether this was an honest mistake, incompetence or a deliberate blind eye been turned is now impossible to say. But with the police knowing from the transmissions on Rowlands radio that the gang were trying to dig their way directly into the vault rather than go in through the front it is staggering that this search was deemed sufficient to dismiss the bank as the possible location of the robbery.</p><h3>D-Notice</h3><p>One of the most persistent rumours about the Lloyds Bank robbery is that a D-notice was placed on the press to prevent them fully reporting the details of the crime. </p><p>A D-notice is a request from the government to the press not to report on a specific event that is deemed a risk to national security. Whilst technically voluntary, the UK press would rarely break a D-notice, and several are still used and in effect today. </p><p>It is not contested that a such a request was made to the press regarding their reporting of the Baker Street robbery. The robbery was known about for almost two days before news of it was broken on the morning of Monday 13th September. During this period, it is thought a D-notice was in effect to prevent any reporting possibly tipping the criminals off.</p><p>The heist was then widely reported for a while, the BBC and most of the national press reported on the crime. After that, news of the raid virtually vanished from the UK media. Radio ham Robert Rowlands, whose recordings of the robbery first alerted police, says his tapes and radio equipment were then seized and a D-notice placed on further reporting. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/safety-deposit-robbery.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was there something so sensitive in the boxes that it had to be covered up?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike similar heists, which have remained in the headlines for months and years afterwards, very little was reported about the robbery again until the publicity generated by the release of the Bank Job in 2008. One small story did appear in The Times in 1973 reporting on the conviction of the three men involved in the raid, but this looks like a curiously scant return for such a sensational crime.</p><p>In recent years, the tabloid Daily Mirror has revealed that they and other major newspapers of the time were approached by senior government officials and asked to drop the story. It is hard to understand why they would do this if there wasn't some element of national security involved. No other major bank robbery in British history has faced the reporting restrictions that seem to be evident here.</p><p>Was this to cover-up the robbery's true intent, or to cover-up what the thieves say they found in the safety deposit boxes and left out for the police to find?</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>A Schoolboy Error</h3><p>MI5 is renowned in the intelligence world for its skill, efficiency, and cunning. When someone working on an MI5 covert operation leases out a shop as a front for their illegal activities, they generally don't do it in their own name, allowing for their swift capture by the police.</p><p>Yet that's exactly what gang member Desmond Wolfe did. With a tunnel leading straight from the bank vault to the basement of the Le Sac leather goods shop he had leased, he was essentially caught red-handed. Wolfe was quickly apprehended and the other gang members, all known associates of Wolfe, soon followed.</p><p>It seems unthinkable that MI5 would be behind such a plan unless the gang agreed to deliberately take the fall for them. No serious intelligence operation would make such a basic mistake otherwise.  </p><p>There's no doubt that the Baker Street heist was brilliantly executed in some respects, but in others ways, it was sloppy and amateurish. Allowing every detail of their plan to be broadcasted over the airwaves seems another mistake uncharacteristic of a professional state intelligence operation.</p><p>By 1971, CB Radio was already massive in America and beginning to take off in the UK, despite still been technically outlawed. The robbers were talking to each other on open channels, potentially allowing any of thousands of people in the area to hear their chatter.</p><p>If MI5 were involved in planning the robbery, then they made some inexplicable errors which led to the certain capture of their thieves. The possibility that them getting caught and going to prison was part of the deal can't be overlooked, but it's a hefty price to pay however much the men were paid.</p><h3>A Conspiracy of Silence</h3><p>The conspiracy theory that British intelligence was involved in the robbery to cover up a royal scandal is not outlandish, but it also revolves around their ability to suppress subsequent reporting using the D-notice system. If they have such a powerful mechanism to cover up their activities, it begs the question as to why the robbery was even needed. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets/lord-boothby-allan-warren.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Lord Boothby's sexual misdemeanours were never reported in the press (credit: Allan Warren)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Journalists in the 1970s already knew what kind of subjects were out of bounds. Princess Margaret's antics in Mustique were well-worn gossip in Fleet Street, as were the sexual proclivities of many other politicians and high profile society figures. But like the often very public behaviour of paedophiles such as Lord Boothby and MP Tom Driberg, anything that could damage the establishment was already not reported by mutual agreement.</p><p>Even today, paedophile scandals are rumbling on at the BBC and Westminister. Revelations continue that many high-profile establishment figures were routinely protected, a conspiracy of silence preventing them from been exposed.</p><p>Elaborate bank robberies seem superfluous in the circumstances. </p>","tile":"the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets","path":"the-baker-street-robbery-vault-of-secrets","date":"2018-02-26T20:23:23.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 26, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"The Baker Street Robbery","subheadline":"Vault of <span>Secrets</span>","snippet":"Was the 1971 Lloyds Bank safety deposit robbery a covert operation to retrieve compromising photos of Royalty?","tags":["crime","bank","robbery","cover-up","conspiracy","mi5","intelligence","media","newspapers","paedophiles","scandal","uk","british"],"title":"The Baker Street Robbery - Vault of Secrets","tileheadline":"Vault of Secrets"},{"body":"<p>-the-black-knight-satellite.jpg</p><p>As the shadow of the 20th century loomed large, enigmatic scientist Nikola Tesla claimed to have received the most amazing message in human history.</p><p>Tesla had just set up in Colorado Springs, where he built a large magnifying transmitter to further his investigations into the wireless distribution of electricity.</p><p>Soon after he began to receive mysterious signals on the equipment, that seemed to be coming from space.

To his amazement, he found some of his morse code messages returning back to him, sometimes years later.</p><p>These discoveries caused a major stir in the press at the time, with talk of aliens from Mars trying to contact the Earth. However, the strange signals were soon relegated to a curious scientific footnote, not to be revived for nearly 30 years.</p><p>In 1927, Jørgen Hals, a civil engineer in Oslo, was using an early commercial radio receiver to listen to shortwave transmissions from a station in Eindhoven when he noticed something extremely odd.</p><p>The signals were being reflected back by something. These echoes came at irregular intervals, sometimes 3 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds. Hals had discovered what would later be known as LDEs - Long Delayed Echoes.</p><p>The LDEs so intrigued scientists that from 1928 to 1930, a huge experiment was conducted into the phenomenon. The echoes were certainly real, but nobody had any idea what was causing them.</p><p>Further experiments in France and the UK in the 1930s left scientists equally baffled. To this day, there is no agreement on what is behind LDEs, although few scientists believe they have anything other than natural origins.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/sputnik-satellite.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sputnik was the first known man-made satellite</div></figcaption></figure><p>But could Tesla’s speculation back in 1899 be correct? Was there some intelligence behind the echoes? Were they even a message from aliens?</p><p>In 1954, an amazing story appeared in technology magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology that suggested exactly that. The US military had discovered 2 mysterious satellites in Earth’s orbit.</p><p>The Pentagon was reportedly furious about the story. They had not wanted the discovery to be made public. An explanation was quickly put out that the satellites were actually asteroids.</p><p>Whilst it is possible for Earth’s orbit to capture an asteroid, it’s extremely rare and only happens under certain unusual circumstances. Many scoffed at the Pentagon’s explanation and the widespread belief at the time was that they were artificial.</p><p>Had the Russians managed to secretly get something into orbit 3 years before Sputnik, the first publicly acknowledged satellite? Or were the objects from further afield in the universe?</p><p>By late 1957, the Soviets had just launched their second satellite — Sputnik II, carrying a passenger, a small dog called Laika. But it also had a more mysterious passenger, because it was been tracked in space by an object and neither the Russians or Americans had any idea what it was.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/american-radar-station.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The press reported that American space radar stations had discovered unknown satellites in orbit</div></figcaption></figure><p>In 1960, the US Navy’s Dark Fence radar system made an even more spectacular discovery. They had detected a large black object in polar orbit around the Earth, possibly weighing as much as 15 tons.</p><p>What was particularly odd about this was neither the US or the Soviets had the ability to put objects in polar orbit in 1960, and the purported weight was far beyond what either country were capable of getting into space.</p><p>Like the incidents in 1954, press reports of the discovery caused a major splash with the public. And like 1954, the Pentagon quickly stepped in to kill the story — it was just space debris from a Discoverer rocket launch, a suggestion that did not convince many.</p><p>Whatever it was in Earth’s orbit had also acquired a name — the Black Knight satellite. The origins of the name are unclear, but it may have been based on an inchoate satellite launching rocket the British had developed called Black Knight.</p><p>The object would continue to be seen, but it was very unpredictable. It would vanish for long periods before reappearing years later. What could it be?</p><p>The most intriguing idea came from an eminent Stanford space scientist, Ronald Bracewell, and his theory for how an alien civilization might communicate with Earth.</p><p>Bracewell proposed such a civilization may send a probe out into the universe looking for planets that could evolve intelligent life. They would lie dormant in orbit around the planet until the occupants were advanced enough to send radio signals into space, at which point it would send a signal back.</p><p>Was the object found by Dark Fence a ‘Bracewell probe’? Fascinated by the possibility, Scottish science writer and amateur astronomer Duncan Lunan decided to go back and reexamine the data produced by the LDE experiments in 1928.</p><p>What Lunan says he found was absolutely astonishing. The Scot had a hunch that the seemingly random delays observed in the echoes from 1928 might be significant. He mapped them on a graph and was staggered to discover they formed the pattern of a constellation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/nasa-artist-bracewell-probe.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">NASA’s idea of a Bracewell Probe</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was Boötes, a constellation in the northern sky home to many bright stars.

Amazingly, he claimed to have decoded a message from it’s inhabitants.</p><p>Had the Black Knight satellite finally revealed its purpose? Was an alien civilization from deep space trying to communicate with the Earth?</p><p>In 1998, compelling visual evidence for the existence of the mysterious satellite finally emerged. The crew of the space shuttle, Endeavour managed to take dozens of clear high-resolution photographs of a strange black object near their craft.</p><p>As in 1960, the object was dismissed as space debris — a thermal blanket that had come loose during the construction of the International Space Station.</p><p>But the photographs just fuelled more speculation about what was in the skies. The old stories of Tesla, the LDEs and Duncan Lunan’s star map were revived.</p><p>After more than a century of speculation, the big question still remained. Are there ancient alien satellites in Earth’s orbit?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>Space UFOs</h3><p>Following the radar sightings in the 1950s and 60s, both the Soviets and the Americans would start to send men into space. If there was something alien up there, it surely wouldn’t be long before one of them encountered it.</p><p>In 1963, astronaut Gordon Cooper was orbiting the planet in his Mercury space capsule. He reported seeing an object near his craft, that glowed with a greenish hue.</p><p>Back on Earth, this UFO was seen by dozens of witnesses on the radar screens at NASA’s Muchea Tracking Station in Australia, and the news was widely reported in the press.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/american-astronaut-gordon-cooper.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">American astronaut Gordon Cooper reported multiple UFO sightings</div></figcaption></figure><p>NASA’s reaction was odd. They forbid reporters from asking Cooper about the UFO.

But after seeing a photograph of the second stage, McDivitt dismissed the possibility — “I am sure that this is not a photograph of the object which I described many times”, he told UFO sceptic Philip Klass.</p><blockquote><span>\"There was something out there, close enough to be observed, and what could it be?\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>In 1969, the astronauts of the most famous space flight of all — Apollo 11, saw something strange out of the module’s window. Early in their journey, Buzz Aldrin described a glowing object outside that appeared to be tracking Apollo’s path.</p><p>At the time, NASA kept the encounter secret, and the astronauts only make an oblique reference to it in their communications. “There was something out there, close enough to be observed, and what could it be?”, Aldrin said in 2005.</p><p>“Now, obviously the three of us weren’t going to blurt out, ‘Hey, Houston, we’ve got something moving alongside of us and we don’t know what it is, you know?’”</p><p>Were the objects encountered by the NASA astronauts Bracewell probes or even the fabled Black Knight satellite?</p><p>According to Gordon Cooper, one of America’s pioneering early astronauts, encounters like these are common and well documented at NASA but are always kept secret.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/major-james-mcdivitt.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Major James McDivitt reported a strange object in Earth’s orbit</div></figcaption></figure><p>“For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all specialists in astronautics.

Lunan made his discovery in 1972, but the star system he saw was not how it looked in the skies then.</p><p>Lunan was puzzled, but he had a hunch. If this really was an alien probe, it must have taken many years to reach Earth, perhaps thousands of years. Could the map be how the constellation looked sometime in the past, a time that would reveal when the probe was launched?</p><p>The hunch proved to be correct, the map matched how Epsilon Boötis looked some 13,000 years ago. If Lunan was right, the implications were staggering. A satellite from a far distant alien civilisation had been orbiting the planet since pre-history.</p><p>Professor Bracewell, who coined the idea of alien satellites, was convinced Lunan had proved his theory. Lunan’s findings were also validated by the prestigious British Interplanetary Society, the oldest space advocacy body in the world.</p><p>But a few years later, Lunan withdrew his findings. Not because the message wasn’t there, but because he no longer believed Epsilon Bootis could sustain intelligent life.</p><p>This seems a somewhat odd position. The information he found in the LDE data was either there or it wasn’t and it seems staggeringly unlikely the message could have occurred by chance.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/stonehenge-illustration.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Lunan claimed that Epsilon Boötis’ location was encoded into ancient monuments like Stonehenge</div></figcaption></figure><p>Lunan hasn’t given up on Epsilon Bootis altogether, however.

This explanation is routinely used whenever news of such discoveries reach the press.</p><p>Back in 1960, when the US Navy radar system Dark Fence spotted a huge object in polar orbit, it was quickly dismissed as space debris from the Discoverer program.</p><p>However, the object Dark Fence observed seemed to be too large and heavy to be space debris. It was estimated to be as much as 15 tons, far in excess of what any country in the world was capable of getting into space in 1960.</p><p>The Russians had the most powerful rockets at the time, but the heaviest payload they could manage was just over 2000 pounds.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/black-satellite-space-shuttle.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The object is much bigger than a piece of thermal blanket</div></figcaption></figure><p>The UFO was incredibly erratic, its orbit was hard to predict and studying it proved difficult. But the Grumman Aircraft corporation in New York managed to get a photograph of it and it was apparently orange.</p><p>Nothing on the Discoverer, a program which was actually a cover for the then secret Corona spy satellite, was orange. Clearly, whatever Dark Fence had spotted was not space debris.</p><p>The most detailed ever pictures of a UFO in space were taken by the space shuttle Endeavor in 1998. These are the images most often cited as proof of the Dark Knight’s existence.</p><p>NASA, however, dismissed the object as a thermal insulation blanket accidentally dropped by an astronaut whilst constructing the International Space Station.</p><p>Again, like the 1960 explanation, this doesn’t quite fit the facts. Although in most of the photos it's hard to determine the scale of the object, one image does show it some distance below the Space Shuttle.</p><p>Even without taking perspective into account, the object appears to be as long as the Shuttle’s cargo bay door, which was 60ft long. This would make it at least 10 times larger than the insulation blankets used on the ISS.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Joining the dots</h3><p>Critics of the Black Knight satellite theory point out that much of the evidence cited in its favour is actually unconnected.</p><p>Of the many Black Knight candidate objects purportedly observed over the years, no two appear alike. The size, color, shape and appearance vary each time. Some have polar orbits, others are equatorial.</p><p>And Duncan Lunan’s proposed alien satellite wasn’t in Earth’s orbit at all, but the Moon’s.</p><p>Some of the sightings also appear not to be genuine. The reports from 1954 about 2 unknown satellites been observed in orbit seems to have originated from articles written by UFO proponent Donald Keyhoe.</p><p>It has been suggested that Keyhoe’s speculations about alien satellites got conflated by the press with real army space tracking experiments conducted by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, to create a completely fictitious story that the army had found UFOs in orbit.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/clyde-tombaug-pluto.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was searching the skies for objects in the 1950s</div></figcaption></figure><p>Gordon Cooper’s reported sighting of a green UFO in 1963 seems solid enough, but even ardent UFO believer Cooper later denied he had made any such observation, attributing it to over-imaginative reporters.</p><p>As for Tesla, whilst accounts of the Black Knight satellite often begin with the famous inventor, his presence in the story doesn’t seem particularly warranted other than to add an extra layer of mystery.</p><p>The signals he observed, whether they were pulsars or not, were quite different to the LDEs and appear to have little or nothing in common with Bracewell probes and the Black Knight Satellite.</p><h3>Spies in the skies</h3><p>The curious phenomena of long delay echoes are pivotal to many of the Black Knight satellite theories. LDEs are reflections of radio signals that return to the observer at random intervals, usually between 3 and 15 seconds.</p><p>If Black Knight was a Bracewell probe, as is often suggested, it would send some kind of signal to alert us to its presence. Are those signals the mysterious LDEs?</p><p>One of the many curious aspects of LDEs is that they were far more common in the early days of radio communications, especially the 1920s and 30s, than they are today.</p><p>If there was some intelligence behind these signals, could it be of a more earthly origin? One suggestion is the signals were part of a top-secret military experiment to piggyback covert signals inside conventional radio station broadcasts.</p><p>A spy could set up his equipment close to a radio tower and rebroadcast its signals with varying delay times, the delays spelling out a message in a similar manner to the dots and dashes of morse code.</p><p>Scandinavia, the source of many of the early LDE observations, was gripped by a puzzling phenomena in the 1930s involving ‘ghostfliers’, strange unidentified aircraft spotted over the countries.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-black-knight-satellite-sentinel-from-space/lde-signals.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Were the LDE signals actually part of a covert espionage operation?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Accompanying the ghost planes were numerous signals, piggybacked on top of commercial radio broadcasts.

Kurt Cobain’s death robbed the outsiders and the alienated of their spokesman, and the world of one of its great musicians.</p><p>The news that the frontman of the influential grunge rock band Nirvana had apparently killed himself with a shotgun blast to the head reverberated around the world. Few bands had had such a seismic effect on the music industry, and few ended with such shocking finality.</p><p>The news was so devastating to some fans that it inspired a wave of tragic copy cat suicides. Others reacted with disbelief — why would the lead singer of the biggest rock band on the planet, idolised by millions of fans, want to take his own life?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/nirvana-band-influential.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Nirvana were one of the most influential bands in rock history (credit: P.B. Rage)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many of Kurt Cobain’s friends and colleagues say they had no idea he was suicidal, indeed he had recently been cured of a chronic stomach complaint and was feeling more positive than he had in years. Yet Cobain’s wife, fellow musician Courtney Love, seemed to be unsurprised by the news.</p><p>She had long worried about Cobain’s state of mind and told the media that the singer was suicidal. In the days before his body was found, Cobain had seemingly gone missing from a drug rehab center, and a worried Courtney Love hired a private detective, Tom Grant, to try and find him.</p><p>Grant never did find Kurt Cobain. On April, 8th, the singer’s body was found by an electrician called to Kurt’s Lake Washington home to install a security system. He was laying on the floor in a room above the garage, the shotgun that killed him resting in his arms.</p><p>He was just 27 years old, earning him the dubious distinction of entry into the ’27 Club’, alongside other famous musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Amy Winehouse, all who died at that age.</p><p>The Seattle Police hastily declared the death a suicide, before the circumstances had even been properly investigated. According to the police, Cobain had taken a massive overdose of heroin, then committed suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a 20 gauge shotgun.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/kurt-cobain-body-crime-scene-police.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kurt’s body as it was found by the Seattle Police</div></figcaption></figure><p>Nearby, what was labelled as a suicide note was found speared to a plant pot with a red biro. The note does not mention suicide and mainly reads like a farewell to the music industry. At the bottom of the note, Cobain says goodbye to Courtney and their daughter Francis Bean, saying they would be better off without him.</p><p>But was this part actually written by Cobain at all, or added by someone else? The 4 lines at the bottom certainly look different to the rest of the note and appear to have been added later, some suspect by a different author.</p><p>That somebody was keen to push the idea the death was a suicide was obvious by the sheer number of false stories that started to appear in the press. One widely reported claim was that Cobain had barricaded himself into the greenhouse, locked the door from the inside and wedged it shut with a chair.</p><p>None of this was true, but it gave the overwhelming impression that Cobain must have committed suicide. Even a line from the suicide note, known only to the police, Tom Grant and Courtney Love, appeared in the media, reading — “I can’t live my life like this any longer”.</p><p>But there was a big problem with this quote — it is not in Cobain’s note. It appears to have been fabricated in order to reinforce the idea the singer had killed himself. Courtney Love was also telling the media that an accidental overdose Cobain had had in Rome the previous month was actually an unsuccessful suicide attempt.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/kurt-cobain-suicide-note-flower-bed.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A note was found stuck to a flower bed near the body</div></figcaption></figure><p>By now, Tom Grant had become suspicious that his client was deliberately planting the false stories in the media to try and manipulate the news agenda. But why was Courtney so keen to push the idea that Cobain was suicidal?</p><p>Right from his first meeting with Love, before Kurt’s body had been discovered, Grant found her behaviour strange. In dozens of phone calls between the pair, all of which Grant recorded, she repeatedly lies to the detective.</p><p>Despite professing worry over his ‘suicidal’ state, Love told Grant she had business in LA during the period Kurt was missing, which meant she was unable to travel back to Seattle to help find him. When Tom Grant mentioned this to Love’s showbusiness attorney Rosemary Carrol, she told the detective that Love — “didn’t have any business in LA!”</p><p>Grant also discovered Kurt had left Courtney and was planning to divorce her. Because the pair had a prenuptial agreement, Love would have ended up with little or nothing from the divorce. But with Cobain dead, and Love his widow, she inherited an estate that could potentially be worth hundreds of million of dollars.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/kurt-cobain-doors.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">False stories appeared in the press that Cobain had barricaded himself into the room and jammed the doors shut with a chair</div></figcaption></figure><p>Rosemary Carroll, who knew Kurt Cobain very well told Grant that not only was he not suicidal but that the supposed suicide note found near his body had clearly been written by someone else. Carrol even produced a sheet of paper she had found in Courtney’s possession on which someone had practised handwriting very similar to that on the note.</p><p>By now Tom Grant suspected that Love may have actually murdered Cobain, a suspicion bolstered by leaked details from the autopsy report. Grant discovered that the amount of heroin Cobain had injected was so huge that it represented more than 3 times the lethal dose, even for the most hardened of addicts.</p><p>Forensic pathologists who have discussed the case in the media feel that such a dose would immediately have rendered Cobain unconscious, making it impossible for him to have then shot himself.</p><p>It was clear that there was something wrong with the official suicide verdict. Could somebody else have forcibly injected Cobain with a huge dose of heroin? And did someone else pull the trigger on the shotgun?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Suicidal</h3><p>It’s not uncommon after a suicide for the friends and families of the victim to express disbelief. The suicidal are often able to disguise their intentions even from the closest of loved ones.</p><p>However, two factors cast doubt on the idea that Cobain was suicidal. Far from been the tortured and gloomy depressive of popular legend, those who knew him best describe the singer as just as likely to be goofing around than angst-ridden.</p><p>Cobain’s playful, often silly sense of humour is clearly evident in many of the interviews he gave, especially those in the years leading up to his death. He would often banter with the audience at his gigs and his journals are full of absurd, whimsical jokes and stories.</p><p>That sense of humour was also evident in Nirvana’s songs. Although renowned for their dark and introspective lyrics, Cobain would always say many of the band’s songs, including the bleak sounding ‘I Hate Myself and Want to Die’ from the In Utero sessions, were actually intended to be jokes.</p><p>None of this means Cobain could not have committed suicide, and there are even those who believe he may have been bipolar, which is regarded as a major suicide danger sign. But for many of those who knew him best in the year leading up to his death, Cobain was a man who looked happier and more contented than he had for years.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/kurt-cobain-and-daughter-frances-bean.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Kurt Cobain was besotted with his young daughter Frances Bean</div></figcaption></figure><p>During his time in Nirvana, the main source of unhappiness for Kurt Cobain was not mental but physical. For years, he had been plagued by a chronic stomach problem that would often be so debilitating it would leave him nauseous and unable to eat properly for days on end.</p><p>Cobain had spent years consulting dozens of doctors in an attempt to diagnose the problem. He would even say his heroin use started in part as an attempt to ease the pain caused by his stomach.</p><p>But in 1992, doctors finally found what had been causing the ailment. A vagus nerve close to his stomach had become pinched and inflamed due to Cobain’s scoliosis. Once properly diagnosed, and given the correct medication, Cobain’s life was transformed.</p><p>In an interview in 1993, the singer stated how he was finally free of the debilitating condition — “My stomach isn’t bothering me anymore. I’m eating. I ate a huge pizza last night. It was so nice to be able to do that. And it just raises my spirits”.</p><p>Cobain’s change of spirits did not go unnoticed to those around him at the time. Dylan Carlson, one of his best friends, later stated — “Kurt became a new person after that. He stopped retreating into the dark side that everybody came to associate with him and actually seemed cheerful”.</p><p>Cobain would state in numerous interviews in 1993 and ’94 how happy he was, and how besotted he was with his young daughter Frances Bean. 6 months before his death he said — “I don’t want to leave behind my wife and child, so I don’t do things that would jeopardise my life. I try to do as little things as I can to jeopardise it. I don’t want to die”.</p><p>Talking about his young daughter, Kurt would say in December 1993 — “I’m not going to say a damn word about it being tough; I’m having the best time of my life!”</p><blockquote><span>\"I’m not going to say a damn word about it being tough; I’m having the best time of my life!\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Just days before his death, Cobain joined an AOL online Q&A event and left a message for his fans, stating how excited he was to be working on new songs — “Hope you people are ready for a calmer moodier album. Yep, Nirvana’s going back into the studio at the end of the summer. I’m already working on the new songs and artwork for the new album”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/courtney-love.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Cobain’s wife Courtney Love was behind a lot of the stories that her husband was suicidal (credit:Andrzej Liguz)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Peter Cleary, another friend of Cobain’s from Seattle, thinks the rumours circulating in the media about Cobain being suicidal were down to Courtney Love. “All the talk only started when Courtney came out after the death and said Rome was a suicide attempt and the media picked up on all her examples of Kurt being suicidal”, he said.</p><p>Kurt Cobain overdosed on Rohypnol and alcohol whilst on tour in Rome in March 1994. Only after his death, barely a month later, would Courtney Love claim this was a suicide attempt. Both Cobain, and the doctor who treated him believed the overdose was actually an accident.</p><p>Osvaldo Galletta, Cobain’s doctor in Rome does not think it was a suicide, and it was never reported as such at the time. “After he woke up, he told me it was an accident”, he said. “We can usually tell a suicide attempt…this didn’t look like one to me”.</p><blockquote><span>\"We can usually tell a suicide attempt…this didn’t look like one to me\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Had Love, as private eye Tom Grant speculated, deliberately spread the false story about Rome been a suicide attempt to reinforce the idea Cobain was suicidal and had killed himself?</p><p>Cynical news management is one thing, but what of the curious ‘suicide note’ found near his body after his death? If, as both Tom Grant and Rosemary Carroll believed, this note was phony then it suggests Love’s desire to portray Cobain as suicidal had the darkest of motives.</p><h3>The Note</h3><p>The note found near Kurt Cobain’s body is often portrayed as a suicide note, although for the most part it does not read like one.</p><p>In the letter, seemingly addressed to Nirvana fans, Cobain speaks at length of his dissatisfaction with the music industry. It is only the last few lines of the note, written in a different style to the rest, that could be construed as the final words of a man about to end his life.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/kurt-cobain-suicide-note.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Cobain’s supposed suicide note is mostly a letter to his fans about quitting the music industry</div></figcaption></figure><p>In a spidery scrawl at the bottom of the note it says — “Please keep going, Courtney.

For Francis for her life which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU!\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Handwriting experts are divided as to whether this writing is actually by Cobain. Contextually, however, there are problems with the note. Kurt refers to his ‘burning nauseous’ stomach, and talks of his plans to quit the music business.</p><p>By the time of his death in April 1994, neither of these things were true. He had been cured of his stomach problems for over a year, and we know from his AOL chatroom message that he was preparing a new album with Nirvana, not planning to quit the business.</p><p>It would seem that this note was not contemporary with Cobain’s death, but a year or more older. Had someone taken an old letter Cobain had written when he was at a low ebb and added the writing at the bottom to make it look like a suicide note?</p><p>A startling piece of evidence discovered by Courtney Love’s attorney Rosemary Carroll suggested just that. Described as a ‘handwriting practise sheet’, Carrol found the piece of paper inside Courtney’s backpack 2 days before Kurt’s body was found.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/courtney-love-handwriting-practise-sheet.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A handwriting practise sheet found in Courtney Love’s bag closely matches the writing on Cobain’s suicide note</div></figcaption></figure><p>The writing that someone, presumably Courtney, had been practising on the sheet bore a resemblance to the dubious bottom part of Kurt Cobain’s so-called suicide note. The obvious suspicion was that Love herself had written this part of the note and tried to pass it off as Kurt’s.</p><p>If so, it would not be the first time Courtney Love had faked Kurt’s handwriting. The previous year she had written a letter to Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, purporting to be from Kurt and telling his bandmates he was quitting the band.</p><p>If Courtney had indeed forged Cobain’s suicide note, it is hard to find a benign motive for her to have done so. Had she, or someone else acting on her behalf, actually shot Cobain and then faked the note to make it appear to be a suicide?</p><p>It wasn’t just the suspicious suicide note that suggested this was a very real possibility. Some forensic pathologists who have studied the case think the amount of heroin in the musician’s body was so great he would not physically have been able to shoot himself.</p><h3>Heroin</h3><p>According to the official story, Kurt Cobain injected himself with a fatal dose of black tar heroin, tidied away his drugs paraphernalia, picked up his shotgun, placed it in his mouth and pulled the trigger.</p><p>The amount of heroin found in Cobain’s bloodstream was, by any standards, absolutely astonishing. His blood-morphine concentration was 1.52mg per litre, which represents more than 3 times the fatal dose for even the most severe of addicts. The effect would have been further exacerbated by his low body weight and the Diazepam in his system.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/cobain-heroin-kit-police-photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Cobain’s heroin kit was found packed away when his body was found</div></figcaption></figure><p>The King County Coroner, who processed Cobain’s case, were stunned by the figures. They represented the highest ever recorded heroin overdose in the county’s history. Could he really have removed his tourniquet, packed away his drug kit and then picked up a shotgun and shot himself after having taken such a huge overdose?</p><p>Canadian chemist Roger Lewis gathered together dozens of toxicology studies regarding drug overdoses to try and find comparable cases. Of the 1526 heroin deaths he found, only 26 had drug levels as high as Cobain and all of them either died instantly or were immediately incapacitated, usually found with the syringe still in their bodies.</p><p>In 2014, the Seattle Police confirmed that Cobain had indeed taken a huge lethal overdose, but argued his tolerance levels were so high he was able to remain conscious long enough to shoot himself. If true, this would make Cobain’s case virtually unique in the medical literature.</p><p>However, it is accepted that tolerance levels amongst drug addicts are not particularly well understood, so it's hard to make any definite claims one way or the other about how long Cobain could have remained conscious. A more fundamental problem is the relationship between heroin overdoses and suicide itself.</p><p>“No study I know of has correlated the use of heroin with suicide”, said Dr Vincent DiMaio, one of America’s most senior forensic pathologists. Dr Cyril Wecht, the former president of the American Academy of Forensic Science who has studied the Cobain case for 20 years, agrees that this form of suicide is highly unusual.</p><blockquote><span>\"No study I know of has correlated the use of heroin with suicide\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>“I cannot think of a case, where I have had someone inject himself with a large amount of heroin and then proceed to kill himself, it just doesn’t make sense”, he said. “Why would he shoot himself before the drug had had chance to take effect?”</p><p>The point Wecht is making is at the heart of the whole case. Even if Cobain had remained conscious after taking the biggest overdose in King County history, he would have been experiencing or anticipating a huge high. It seems deeply unlikely that he would choose that of all moments to shoot himself.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/seattle-police-cobain-suicide.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Seattle Police immediately jumped to the conclusion that Cobain’s death was suicide</div></figcaption></figure><p>Roger Lewis, whose study of toxicology reports demonstrated the improbability that Cobain could have remained conscious long enough to shoot himself, also looked at hundreds of cases of violent suicides.</p><p>As Wecht and DiMaio suggested, there was not a single instance anywhere in the literature of someone taking a large dose of heroin then shooting themselves. The preponderance of evidence suggests that for all intents and purposes this scenario simply does not occur.</p><p>Many believe the Seattle Police acted with undue hasty in labelling the Cobain crime scene a suicide, and that their early verdict clouded their judgement and prevented them properly investigating alternative scenarios.</p><p>According to Vernon J. Geberth, a retired Lieutenant-Commander of the New York City Police Department, this is not uncommon. Geberth wrote a standard textbook on crime scene protocol and cites dozens of examples of murders been staged as suicides going undetected due to lazy police work.</p><p>“I have personally investigated many such cases and the truth of the matter is that initially; the cases did look like suicides”, he stated. “The investigator cannot assume anything as a professional law enforcement officer”, but, he said — “Without a doubt investigators take short-cuts when they hear the word suicide”.</p><h3>Shell location</h3><p>When Kurt Cobain’s body was found, he was laying flat out on the floor of the greenhouse with a shotgun resting on top of his body. The shotgun was upside down, and Cobain’s left hand was clutching the barrel.</p><p>As Cobain was found holding the gun in an inverted position, the exit chamber for the shell pointed to his right side. The shell of the shot that killed him was, however, found to the left side of Cobain’s body.</p><p>Had the shotgun actually been carelessly placed in Cobain’s hand after his death in order to make it appear he had pulled the trigger himself? The Seattle Police explained away the discrepancy by suggesting the recoil of the shotgun had caused it to rotate 180 degrees after Cobain fired it, but this appears questionable.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/remington-shotgun-cobain-suicide.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Remington shotgun was found near Cobain’s foot, and the shell from the fatal bullet to his left</div></figcaption></figure><p>Cobain had deliberately purchased a low power 20 gauge shotgun to act as a deterrent to intruders, rather than to actually kill anyone. The shotgun was known to have a very low recoil, and was actually so underpowered that even though it had gone off in his mouth the shot did not exit his head.</p><p>Nikolas Hartshorne, who performed Kurt Cobain’s autopsy, believes the musicians left hand was tightly gripping the barrel because of phenomena called ‘Cadaveric Spasm’, which causes instant rigor mortis upon the moment of death. This indicated the gun was probably found in the same position it was fired.</p><p>Whilst on the face of it this supports the suicide verdict, it could equally be that someone placed the gun in Cobain’s hand then fired it from the same position it was found. Such a scenario might also explain the incongruous location of the shotgun shell.</p><p>It is feasible that the shell was ejected towards the right but deflected off some object causing it to land towards the left of Cobain’s body. Whilst there is nothing at the crime scene that could have done this, the possible presence of one or more people around Cobain’s body when the gun was fired could have caused the deflection.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Suicide Risk</h3><p>Although a lot of the evidence that indicates Cobain had committed suicide is tainted by Courtney Love’s media spin and manipulation, there is still a case to be made that the singer was at high risk of killing himself.</p><p>Cobain’s cousin Bev Cobain has claimed the star had bipolar syndrome, a type of clinical depression characterised by extreme mood swings. It is well documented that alongside his bursts of creative and emotional energy, Cobain would have periods where he would be lethargic and withdrawn, both key indicators of the disorder.</p><p>Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a leading expert on bipolar syndrome, cites Kurt Cobain in her 2004 study ‘Cultural Legends with Mental Illnesses’, and many of Nirvana’s lyrics contain obvious references to depression. The song Lithium, both musically and lyrically, appears to be about bipolar syndrome, and Lithium itself is one of the major drugs for treating the disease.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/cobain-suicide-hospital-tag-crime-scene.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The hospital tag from the drug rehab center was still around Cobain’s wrist when he was found</div></figcaption></figure><p>Bipolar syndrome is regarded as a major risk factor for suicide, especially when combined with alcohol and drug abuse. Studies have shown that 25–50% of bipolar suffers attempt suicide at least once in their life and there are indications, even discounting the disputed Rome overdose, that Cobain had tried to kill himself before.</p><p>In a tape recorded in 1988, Kurt describes an early suicide attempt — “I walked down to the train tracks and laid down and put two big pieces of cement on my chest and legs and waited for the 11 o’clock train. And the train came closer and closer and closer. And it went on the next track beside me instead of over me”.</p><p>There was also a history of mental illness and suicide in Cobain’s family. Two of his great uncles shot themselves and his great grandfather stabbed himself in front of Kurt’s grandmother. Cobain himself even had a direct encounter with suicide as a child when he and his friends found a classmate who had hung himself outside of their school.</p><p>Kurt would often talk about his dark and nihilistic feelings when he was a teenager and suicide, in particular, appeared to occupy him. Those obsessions would continue into adulthood, although he would often dismiss them as jokes.</p><p>Even after achieving fame, riches and adulation with Nirvana, many of those that knew Cobain describe a deeply troubled man racked with feelings of inadequacy, alienation and anxiety. Tellingly, those who spent more time with Cobain than anyone else in the years before his death — his Nirvana band mates, all believe he committed suicide.</p><p>Krist Novoselic, Nirvana’s bassist, recalled seeing Kurt days before his death. “He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn’t connecting with anybody”.</p><blockquote><span>\"He just wanted to get fucked up into oblivion. There was no talking to him. He wanted to escape. He wanted to die, that was what he was going to do\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Novoselic was particularly disturbed by Cobain’s mental state and reliance on drugs at the time - \"He just wanted to get fucked up into oblivion. There was no talking to him. He wanted to escape. He wanted to die, that was what he was going to do\".</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away/seattle-park-bench-cobain-tribute.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">After Cobain’s death, a park bench near his home in Seattle became an unofficial memorial for grieving fans (credit: Joe Mabel)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Brett Morgan, the director of recent Kurt Cobain documentary ‘Montage of Heck’, thinks the musician killed himself because of the breakdown of his relationship the Courtney Love. “He thought his wife cheated on him, and her and Frances were all he had”, he said. “And so when that was broken in his mind, there was this sense of humiliation. Kurt Cobain died of a broken heart”.</p><p>Despite the obvious problems with the case, Kurt Cobain possessed many of the classic danger signs for suicide — he had bipolar syndrome, was in the middle of a breakup, was addicted to drugs and had a family history of mental illness. It is not entirely surprising that many of his closest friends believe he probably did kill himself that dark day in April 1994.</p><p>“It’s better to burn out than to fade away”. Whether those words, written on the note found near Kurt Cobain’s body, referred to his desire to leave the music industry, or his desire to leave the world altogether, will never be known.</p><p>But either way they seem apt. Like the other members of the 27 club, Kurt Cobain’s legend is fixed in time. His immense standing as a musician will forever be untarnished and dimmed by the ravages of age, never fading away.</p>","tile":"the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away","path":"the-death-of-kurt-cobain-never-fade-away","date":"2018-02-26T20:23:09.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 26, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"The Death of Kurt Cobain","subheadline":"Never <span>Fade Away</span>","snippet":"Was Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain’s death, officially ruled a suicide, actually murder?","tags":["Kurt","Cobain","Courtney","Love","murder","unsolved","suicide","Nirvana","music","band","heroin","overdose","drugs","shotgun","shot"],"title":"The Death of Kurt Cobain - Never Fade Away","tileheadline":"Never Fade Away"},{"body":"<p>-amityville-house.jpg</p><p>The iconic Dutch Colonial style building at 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, is best known today for the extraordinary account of a haunting at the house in 1976.</p><p>The Amityville Horror, as it was soon known, became one of the most famous incidents of paranormal activity ever recorded.

George Lutz and his wife Kathy invented the haunting with the help of lawyer and literary agent William Weber.</p><p>But the paranormal version obscures a very real horror, one far more frightening and mysterious than the fanciful tales of poltergeists Hollywood gave the world.

Defeo’s mother and father were both shot in their beds, worst still, four of their children had been slaughtered as well.</p><p>One of the men, Joe Yeswit, called the Suffolk County police with the awful news. On their arrival, a search of the house confirmed the worst — every member of the Defeo family, save for Butch, were dead.</p><p>The victims were Ronald DeFeo Sr, 43, Louise DeFeo, 42 and four of their children — Dawn, 18, Allison, 13, Marc, 12 and John Matthew, 9.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/butch-defeo-and-family.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Butch Defeo — right, with his 4 siblings</div></figcaption></figure><p>Each of them had been shot execution style, at close range as they slept, and all 6 were found laying in their beds face down on their stomachs.</p><p>As police trawled the house, the lone survivor, Butch Defeo, cut a forlorn figure outside, refusing to go inside. Defeo mentioned to officers that he felt a mob hit-man was responsible for the killings, a suggestion taken seriously because of the methodical way the family seemed to have been killed.</p><p>Defeo was taken into police custody for his own protection but didn’t stick to his mob story for very long. Within 24 hours the surviving Defeo had made a shocking confession — he had murdered his entire family himself.</p><p>“Once I started, I just couldn’t stop. It went so fast.” Defeo told stunned detectives. After the murders, he admitted, he took a shower, changed his clothes and disposed of the murder weapon.</p><p>With a full confession, the subsequent investigation seemed straight forward. At around 3:15 am on November 13, Butch Defeo had awoken, and for reasons that may forever remain unclear, took a .35 caliber Marlin rifle and systematically shot all 6 members of his family.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/butch-defeo-arrest-photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Butch Defeo’s arrest photo</div></figcaption></figure><p>But even some of the detectives, keen to quickly wrap up their biggest ever murder case, could see there was something very wrong with this story.</p><p>How had Butch shot 6 people in 4 different rooms without any of them waking up? How had no neighbours heard the rifle blasts? If everyone was shot in bed, how had blood splatter got on the floor and a dresser?</p><p>Many had begun to feel Butch could not have acted alone. Unburnt gunshot residue on Defeo’s sister Dawn even indicated she might have been involved.</p><p>Were there other gunmen in the Defeo family massacre?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Waking the Dead</h3><p>At the subsequent trial, Ronald Defeo Jr proved to be a terrible witness. His story constantly changed and his erratic and strange behaviour alienated him to everyone. He even threatened to kill the judge and his own lawyer.</p><p>On November 21, 1975, he was found guilty on 6 counts of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 6 concurrent 25-year sentences, although he is unlikely to ever be released. But despite the conviction, it was clear there was a serious problem with the official story.</p><p>The court had determined that Defeo had acted alone, killing all 6 members of his family with a .35 gauge Marlin rifle. Defeo had supposedly shot each victim as they slept, and both prosecution and defence agreed he had not used a silencer.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/amityville-crime-scene-mother-father.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Defeo’s mother and father were both shot twice and were found laying face down in their beds</div></figcaption></figure><p>How had Defeo committed the shooting alone without any of his family waking up? Defence experts had conducted an experiment on the Marlin rifle and found its report was so loud that it could be heard almost a mile away.</p><p>According to the autopsy and ballistic reports, each victim was shot as they were found, face down in their beds. It seemed none of them had been awoken by the shots, and none had put up any kind of struggle or tried to hide or flee the scene.</p><p>Ken Greguski, the former Amityville police chief, was one of the first law enforcement professionals at the scene. To this day he finds it hard to believe Defeo could have committed the shootings without any members of his family waking — “Why someone wasn’t able to get out of that house is beyond belief”, he later said.</p><blockquote><span>\"Why someone wasn’t able to get out of that house is beyond belief\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>What made this particularly inexplicable was the locations of the 6 bodies strongly suggested Defo could not have committed the shootings so rapidly that nobody had time to react.</p><p>In fact, Defeo had fired a total of 8 ear-shredding shots, estimated to be 140 decibels each, in 4 different rooms of the sprawling house, across 2 different floors. And yet it seems he had not disturbed anyone.</p><p>Nor did any neighbours hear the shots. 112 Ocean Avenue was not an isolated property, it was surrounded quite closely be other homes. When police interviewed the residents, nobody reported hearing anything except the barking of the Defeo family dog.</p><p>Dr Howard Adelman, deputy chief medical examiner of Suffolk County, was present at the crime scene and personally conducted the autopsies on the Defeo family. He testified at the trial that he felt it was impossible one person could have committed the crimes.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/dawn-defeo-murder.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Dawn Defeo’s bedroom was on the third floor, away from the other victims</div></figcaption></figure><p>“Even if they were sleeping the report of the weapon that was used is supposed to be so loud that it would have, so to speak, awakened the dead”, he said. And neither had any of the victims been drugged.</p><p>“We did extensive toxicology not only on the blood and urine but on all of the organs that we removed and it turned up zero that there wasn’t anything in their body”, Adelman explained.</p><p>The idea that Butch Defeo had committed the crimes on his own was becoming increasingly untenable. Even the man who secured Defeo’s 25-to-life prison sentence for the crimes, prosecutor Gerard Sullivan, long suspected that other shooters were involved.</p><p>“I wonder about the questions that were never answered. Did any of the victims wake up? If so, why didn’t any of them defend themselves? Why were all six found face down in death? Why didn’t’ anyone hear the shots?”, he wrote in his book High Hopes in 1981.</p><p>If then, as seemed likely, Defeo hadn't acted alone. Who had helped him commit this horrifying crime?</p><h3>Dawn</h3><p>Several investigators and authors have suggested Butch Defeo’s oldest sister Dawn played some part in the shootings.</p><p>The first 5 victims were on the 2nd floor of the Defeo house. Ronald Snr and mother Louise Defeo were both shot twice in the master bedroom. Moving across to the other side of the house, the gunman then shot the 2 boys, Marc and John.</p><p>Completing the 2nd floor shootings, 13 year old Alison Defeo was shot once in the head. That’s a total of 7 shots, at 140 decibels each, before the gunman even started to ascend the stairs to Dawn Defeo’s 3rd floor bedroom.</p><p>It is, therefore, unthinkable that Dawn, entirely unsedated or drugged, would not already have been alerted to a gunman before they had even arrived on the 3rd floor. Yet as we have seen, she appeared to be peacefully asleep, face down in her bed, having made no attempt to escape, defend herself or hide.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/amityville-dawn-defeo-crime-scene.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Dawn, like the other victims, was found face down in her bed</div></figcaption></figure><p>Had Dawn, as some suspected, actually participated in the shooting herself, only to then be shot by her brother and placed in her bed?</p><p>Although Butch Defeo is notorious for the sheer number of contradictory stories he has told about the murders over the years, one of his more consistent accounts is, indeed, that Dawn took part in the killings.</p><p>In most versions of his story, he has claimed responsibility for the murder of his mother and father and showed little remorse for them. But he has often blamed Dawn for killing the families children — Marc, John and Allison. After discovering what she had done, Defeo says he then killed Dawn after a struggle with the rifle.</p><p>Some evidence does exist to tentatively support this scenario. Dawn seems to have been killed somewhere other than her bed and placed there after he death.</p><p>Crime scene investigators discovered that Dawn had suffered a huge head wound, and that brain matter and blood was on her pillow, bedclothes and nightgown. Yet her white headboard, just inches from her head, was pristine. The lack of blood splatter was strongly indicative that she had been shot somewhere else.</p><p>Blood splatter was also found on a dresser and floorboards in the house, again demonstrating the possibility at least some of the shootings had occurred away from the beds.</p><p>Some investigators have speculated that unburnt gunshot residue found on Dawn’s body indicate she may have handled a firearm or ammunition, although the prosecution expert at the trial, Alfred Della Penna, thought this could have occurred as a result of the muzzle flash when Dawn was shot.</p><p>Rick Moran, amongst the first group of reports at the scene the night the bodies were discovered, has studied the Defeo murders for more than 30 years. He is sure that Dawn was involved in some way.</p><p>Moran cites one of Butch Defeo’s strangest claims amongst his many conflicting statements as evidence. Defeo has said several times that on the night of the shootings he was watching TV in a drug induced haze when a strange black hooded figure came to him and handed him a rifle, and urged him to commit the murders.</p><p>Moran thinks this figure could have been Dawn. According to the reporter, Dawn was often spotted by neighbours wearing a black snorkel style coat, which may have led a heavily stoned Butch to mistake her for the sinister figure.</p><p>Although clearly highly anecdotal, Moran says one of his contacts at the Drug Enforcement Agency backs up the story. He had told Moran that someone from the DEA actually had the house under surveillance the night of the murders, due to a suspicion that Butch had been smuggling drugs in his speedboat.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/amityville-house-blood-splatter.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Blood splatter found on walls and floors indicated some victims were shot away from their beds</div></figcaption></figure><p>This DEA agent had supposedly observed Dawn in her black coat leaving the house with a rifle, getting into a car and driving off in the direction the firearm was subsequently found by the police.</p><p>If Dawn and Butch plotted the murders together, could Butch’s incapacity due to heavy drug use have spurred Dawn to commit them herself? And once Butch had come down, had he shot Dawn after the horror of what she had done dawned on him?</p><p>On the face of it this scenario seems far-fetched. But it does help explain many of the puzzling and intractable issues with the crime scene. And evidence from the trial indicates Dawn’s mindset may have been disturbed enough to make her taking such extreme actions seem at least plausible.</p><p>Dawn’s boyfriend William Davidge stated to the court that Dawn was a habitual user of LSD and mescaline and had recently started to become extremely hostile towards her parents because they had refused to allow her to live with him.</p><p>The Defeo family were by all accounts dysfunction and troubled, and Ronald Defeo Snr was reported to be particularly violent, controlling and abusive to both his wife and children, all commonly cited factors in parenticide.</p><p>Butch Defeo has given several different versions of the murders in which people other than Dawn Defeo were part of the conspiracy, but with little or no evidence to support them, Dawn remains the most likely candidate for an extra shooter.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>The Bad Seed</h3><p>In the hours following the shooting, when police interviewed local Amityville residents, many told the detectives they felt Butch Defeo was responsible.</p><p>Considering the reputation Defeo had developed in the sleepy community, it was not so surprising that residents immediately felt he had committed the atrocity. Over the years, he was continually in trouble for his thuggish and erratic behaviour, theft and drug abuse.</p><p>During the run up to the murders, Defeo’s drug taking had become particularly acute. By his own admission, he was consuming huge amounts of heroin and marijuana and drinking a bottle of scotch every day, despite already been on probation for drug crimes at the time.</p><p>His violence was also spiralling out of control. At the trial, much testimony was offered for Defeo’s temper and obsession with guns. One witness recalled how Defeo had held a shotgun up at the head of a young man during a hunting party, and watched stony-faced as the man turned white with fear.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/ronald-defeo-and-father.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Ronald's Jr and Sr had an abusive and violent relationship</div></figcaption></figure><p>On another occasion, Defeo has held a 12 gauge shotgun up against his father’s head during an argument and even pulled the trigger. The shotgun failed to fire and Defeo Snr reportedly found religion soon afterwards.</p><p>Psychologists subsequently diagnosed Butch as having anti-social personality disorder, displaying little or no empathy for other people. Some speculated that Defeo’s many different accounts of the murders were attempts to shift blame for the deaths of his siblings to anyone but himself.</p><p>Whilst Defoe showed no feelings for his mother and detested his father, he would always become agitated and upset when talking about the deaths of his brothers and little sister. If he could successfully convince others and perhaps even himself that someone else had killed the children, it may have helped to assuage his own guilt about the murders.</p><h3>Ballistics</h3><p>One of the major problems with the multiple gunmen scenario is the testimony of the prosecution’s ballistics experts who stated all of the wounds to the 6 victims were made with the same firearm.</p><p>A study of the wounds to the Defoe family, and the expended cartridges found at the crime scene indicated 8 shots had been fired. All 8 shell casing were found and forensically linked to the .35 caliber Marlin rifle found by police thrown in the dock directly behind the house.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-defeo-family-massacre-amityville-horrors/butch-defeo-room.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Ammunition for the murder weapon was found in Butch’s room</div></figcaption></figure><p>Although Herman Race, an experienced criminologist hired by the defence, disputed this ballistic evidence, it seemed quite conclusive.

His documentary style film would probably be forgotten today if it hadn't purported to depict a series of incredible real events that had recently taken place in Fouke, a small rural town in Arkansas.</p><p>People had always seen strange things stalking the shadows around Boggy Creek. The lonely, isolated woodland holds many dark secrets and in May, 1971, a local resident was about to come face to face with one of them.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/legend-of-boggy-creek-film.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Legend of Boggy Creek’s release in 1972 caused a sensation</div></figcaption></figure><p>When reporter Jim Powell first got the call, he could hardly of known he was about to stumble upon the biggest story of his life. Powell had been tipped off that a local resident, Bobby Ford, was been treated at the St. Michael Hospital in Texarkana because he had been attacked by nothing less than a monster.</p><p>Ford was at his brother’s house, sometime around midnight, when it struck. The huge, black, Bigfoot-like creature attacked him in the yard, grabbing him by the shoulder and pinning him to the ground. Ford managed to struggle free from the beast's grasp and escape with just scratches and a case of shock.</p><p>According to the Fords, their first encounter with the mysterious animal occurred earlier that evening, when Ford’s wife Elizabeth had seen a 7ft tall black figure, eyes as red as hot coal, lurking on the porch outside of her window. Bobby and his brother Don, returning from a hunting trip, managed to get a few shots in before the creature retreated back into the woods.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/charles-b-pierce.jpg?-i4\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Ad-man Charles B. Pierce was behind The Legend of Boggy Creek</div></figcaption></figure><p>Investigators later examined the Ford property and failed to find any traces of blood, but did observe scratches and damage to the house, as well as some three-toed footprints in the back yard.</p><p>The Ford encounter was only the first of a spate of similar sightings in Southern Arkansas that summer, stretching from the Sulphur River Bottoms to the town of Fouke itself. As news of the monster began to spread, the local newspapers were inundated with more extraordinary tales about what had quickly become dubbed the Fouke Monster.</p><p>These stories did not go unnoticed by Charles B. Pierce, an Arkansas advertising executive and commercials director keen to break into features. Sensing that the sensational stories coming out of the area would make a terrific horror movie, Pierce got together a shoestring budget of $160,000 and quickly filmed The Legend of Boggy Creek in and around Fouke in the summer of 1972.</p><p>The film was a massive hit and became an instant cult classic, grossing a staggering $25m (over 100 times its budget) and catapulting the monster to international fame. While hokey and ramshackle by today’s standards, the film was influential for its pioneering use of a pseudo-documentary style which gave it a sense of gritty realism rare at the time.</p><p>Boggy Creek’s mixture of talking heads and reenactments can be seen in everything from paranormal TV documentaries like In Search Of... to similar breakout horror film The Blair Witch Project, which was directly inspired by Pierce’s movie.</p><p>It also led to a rash of copycat films such as Creature from the Black Lake and cameo appearances by Bigfoot-like creatures in TV shows, include one memorably unlikely encounter with the Six Million Dollar Man.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/bigfoot-six-million-dollar-man.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A Bigfoot like creature made a curious appearance in the Six Million Dollar Man</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Legend of Boggy Creek eschews professional actors, instead relying on real Fouke residents who had personally seen the monster, recounting their experiences.

And would such a creature even be viable in the swamps and woodland of rural Arkansas?</p><p>Despite the impressive number of sightings, and the foot casts, tangible physical evidence of the Fouke monster remains elusive. No photographs have yet emerged, and no verified traces of hair, scat or bones have ever been found.</p><p>Cryptids like this are notoriously shy, rarely leaving behind any definitive evidence of their existence. But with so many sightings, many from experienced hunters, could the swamp stalker of Boggy Creek really exist?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The early sightings</h3><p>Perhaps due to the film, the Fouke monster is often written off as a short lived craze, a self-fueling piece of mass hysteria driven by overactive imaginations. But a look back through the local history books reveals strange creatures had been seen long before The Legend of Boggy Creek hit theatres in 1972.</p><p>As early as the 1850 tales from hunters of ‘wild men’ attacking cattle and stealing food were quite common in Arkansas. One improbable story, published in the Louisiana Caddo Gazette in 1856, even had the beast in question stealing a hunter's horse and riding off with it.</p><p>But the first recognisable sighting of our monster comes from way back in 1908, deep in the memory recesses of even the oldest Fouke residents. That year a large dark haired ‘monkey-man’ eerily similar to what would later be christened the Fouke Monster was seen by an 10 year old girl.</p><p>Eight years later another black, hairy, man-like beast was spotted in nearby Knight’s Bluff. In 1932 a Jonesville man saw what seemed to be the same monster scratching around on his porch, before it vanished into the woods. A further sighting was reported to Fouke sheriffs in 1946, described as walking like a man but ‘not a man’.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/boggy-creek.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The monster has long been seen in the woods and swamps of rural Arkansas</div></figcaption></figure><p>1955 saw a cluster of new sightings around Fouke and Jonesville, including two motorists who saw a hairy, man like creature flitting across the road near their home. Shortly after, the Victoria Advocate reported how one huntsman claimed to have got 15 shots off at a large ‘apeman’ close to nearby Boggy Creek, but apparently missed.</p><p>The next spate of sightings occurred in the mid-60s, largely amongst hunters. One typical description had the creature at seven-foot tall with “reddish-brown hair about four inches long all over its body. It stood upright like a man, but had extra-long arms”.</p><p>A particularly notable encounter from this time-period was that of Carl Finch, the founder of band Brave Combo, who saw a large hairy bipedal creature late one night whilst driving through the area with his cousin. What was an interesting personal anecdote only took on further significance after Finch saw The Legend of Boggy Creek several years later, and realised he had seen the now famous beast first hand.</p><p>These various sightings were intermittent and highly anecdotal, but also persistent and somewhat consistent. For the grizzled old veterans in the sheriff's department the stories of monsters were all too familiar, shrugged off as an amusing local legend. But whatever was out there in the swamps of Boggy Creek it was about to break out and achieve international fame.</p><h3>The great monster mash of ’71</h3><p>Despite the plethora of early sightings, it wasn't until the early 1970s that the beast lurking around the dark environs of Fouke started to make national headlines.</p><p>Shortly after Bobby Ford’s hospitalization in early May 1971, the previous trickle of monster sightings started to become a torrent. Route 71, a vast 1500 mile long highway that bisects the country north to south and passes through over 300 miles of Arkansas, would play host to many of them.</p><p>In mid-May, Mr. D Woods, his wife Wilma Woods and their friend were driving along the road near Boggy Creek when they saw something strange in the headlights. Running across the road in front of the well-respected local residents was a huge hairy ape like creature with long arms and dark hair.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/fouke-monster-newspaper-reports.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Monster stories were a staple of the local press for years</div></figcaption></figure><p>Wilma Woods recounted the story to the Texarkana Daily News the next day. “It was hunched over and running upright. It had long dark hair and looked real large. It was swinging its arms, kind of like a monkey does. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but there it was. My husband turned to me after it crossed the road and asked me if I saw it, too”.</p><blockquote><span>\"It was hunched over and running upright. It had long dark hair and looked real large. It was swinging its arms, kind of like a monkey does…\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Shortly after, Fouke gas station owner Willie Smith made an unusual discovery in the soybean field that backed his property. A set of curious three-toed animal prints, alarming in their size, leading away from the garage. These three-toed prints were very similar to the ones found around the Ford property the previous month, indicating they may have had a common perpetrator.</p><p>Smith’s find became a local spectacle, with Fouke residents flocking to the field to see the prints. A group of them even saw the monster lurking in the bushes that edged the field, perhaps observing the attention it’s tracks had caused in the local community.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/boggy-creek-monster-tourist-display.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The legacy of the Fouke monster lives on in the town’s tourism industry today</div></figcaption></figure><p>Game warden Carl Galyon was baffled by the casts, as they matched nothing he had ever seen before in the area. The prints even made their way to Dr. Frank Schambagh, an archeology professor at Southern Arkansas University, who somewhat dampened the fervour by suggesting they might be a hoax.</p><p>If this was the case, then it would probably entail some degree of collusion between Smith and the Fords, as the prints found at the different properties appeared to have a common source. But whether the prints were genuine or not, the sightings kept coming.</p><p>That summer alone, the monster made dozens of further appearances, almost as if it was audition for its forthcoming starring role in The Legend of Boggy Creek.</p><p>A red eyed, hairy creature was spotted squatting near the woods adjacent to the homes of several Fouke residents. A child also reported seeing the same thing running into the woods a few nights later. Willie Smith’s soybean field played host to more cameo appearances, with a woman and two men seeing a large 6ft tall hairy creature walking along the road near the field.</p><p>One particularly notable sighting involved several campers at nearby Mercer Bayou. A family preparing their boat for a trip out onto the lake heard a piercing howl followed by what they described as a large sasquatch like creature emerging from the woods. Panicked campers ran from the trailers to try and get a shot at the monster but it fled before they could make a hit.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/boggy-creek-marsh.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Many of the sightings were in the vicinity of the Sulphur River</div></figcaption></figure><p>The beast of Boggy Creek was suddenly everywhere, spotted by Fouke residents and out of state tourists alike. Many of these stories were recounted in Charles B Pierce's film, and dozens more were reported in the local papers. Was this some case of mass hysteria, a collective delusion or an elaborate, all consuming local hoax?</p><p>If it was a real creature then it remained decidedly elusive. Even when a $1000 bounty was placed on the monster by Little Rock radio station KAAY, the county's finest hunters, wielding packs of hounds, failed to find a trace of it.</p><p>Despite this, the reality of the monster had become firmly established in the community; too many people had seen it to simply dismiss it as a figment of overactive imaginations. The sightings would continue to come in for several more years, although by the mid 70s they had decreased substantially in frequency.</p><p>But they never truly go away. At least once a year somebody sees a large hairy creature lumbering along the edges of the woods or running down the dark highways at night. As recently as 2016 people are still seeing it, or perhaps the son or grandson of it.</p><p>After all, If it was the same beast all these years then it must be very old indeed, if it is even a flesh and blood animal at all. Perhaps, as some believe, the real entity hiding out in the woods and swamps of rural Arkansas is stranger then we can possibly imagine.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Stranger Things</h3><p>The aforementioned Dr. Frank Schambagh felt the three-toed footprint casts from Willie Smith’s soybean field could not have been made by an apeman. Anthropologists have never found any kind of hominid or primate, past or present, with anything less than five toes.</p><p>Since the monster was almost universally described by witnesses as an ape or apeman, it would rule out the tracks as genuine, unless the beast was an exceptional evolutionary outlier. Likewise the casts made at the Ford house, which also had three toes, appear to contradict what the family claimed to have seen.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/shannon-print-fouke-monster.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">One of the many footprint casts of the creature</div></figcaption></figure><p>Even other Bigfoot and Sasquatch casts made all around the Pacific North West of America always show five toes, making the monster highly unusual in cryptid lore. Only the so called Honey Island Swamp Monster, also described as three-toed, bares a resemblance. Is it just coincidence that this creature is said to reside very close to Fouke in neighbouring Louisiana?</p><p>Could the two animals be related, or even one and the same? If so it does not overcome the other objections to the Fouke footprints. The Smith cast shows a foot that is long and thin, around 13 by 4 inches. This is quite unlike any known species of primate, which invariably have wider feet to support their size and weight.</p><p>The kind of evenly sized straight toes on the cast are also alien to any species of ape or hominid, who all have splayed, unevenly sized toes. Could the Fouke monster still be a primate, but one exhibiting mutation or injury? It seems unlikely in light of the number of sightings that had the creature running upright like a human.</p><p>Beyond the technical objections, scientists rarely value footprint casts too highly as evidence. The casts themselves invariably have uncertain and dubious origins, and cryptozoology has over the years earned a somewhat well deserved reputation for fakery.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/fouke-monster-footprint-willie-smith-soybean-field.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The cast of the footprint found in Willie Smith’s soybean field</div></figcaption></figure><p>Indeed in later years, the design of the footprints found in the area began to evolve to become more conventionally ape-like, which naturally raises the suspicion that this was simply hoaxers becoming more sophisticated in their efforts. It certainly didn’t attest well for the credibility of a real monster, which would have to be exhibiting a now supernatural ability to grow extra toes.</p><p>It would be unfair to entirely dismiss the whole Fouke monster phenomena as fakery however; clearly many of the witnesses who saw some kind of strange animal in the area were genuine people. But could the creature so many encountered be a somewhat less fantastical beast?</p><h3>Where the Wild Things Roam</h3><p>Bigfoot like creatures are often dismissed by skeptics as misidentified black bears. On many occasions the elusive hard evidence that might finally prove the existence of Bigfoot - scat, hairs, bones, DNA, has turned out to be bear. Could the Fouke monster simply be one of Arkansas’ native black bears?</p><p>The black bear is a good fit size wise with most of the descriptions of the Boggy Creek monster. Weighting up to 400 pounds, the bear can rear up on its hind legs and reach heights of 6 or 7ft.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-fouke-monster-legend-of-boggy-creek/fouke-monster-black-bear.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was the monster simply a misidentified black bear?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the sightings occurred at night, in the woods or other rural areas.

The vast monolithic stone monument at Giza has inspired awe and provoked mystery for millennia.</p><p>Standing near the equally mysterious pyramids of Giza, the huge sculpture depicts a mythical Sphinx, a creature with the body of a lion and the head of a man. Carved right out of the living bedrock, even today it remains the largest monolithic stone statue ever built.</p><p>Conventional wisdom tells us the Sphinx was created in the old kingdom period around 2500BC, and is a monument to the Pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the second of the three pyramids of Giza. Indeed, the face of the statue is supposed to be that of the old dynasty king.</p><p>This is, however, a fairly modern assumption. History itself is eerily silent on the enigmatic monuments true origins. There is no mention of the Sphinx in any known inscription of the old kingdom, and no other inscriptions of any date describe it’s construction.</p><p>The new kingdom pharaohs simply referred to it as Horus on the Horizon, and its modern name of Sphinx derives from the Greeks, 2000 years after its supposed construction.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/statue-of-pharaoh-khafre.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A statue of the pharaoh Khafre in the Cairo Museum (credit: Jon Bodsworth)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Today, Egyptology's attribution of the Sphinx to Khafre is largely circumstantial. It’s location, close to the pharaoh’s pyramid, is one factor, as is a diorite statue found nearby which it is claimed bears a resemblance to the face of the Sphinx.</p><p>The only specific mention to Khafre in relationship to the Sphinx is found in the Dream Stele, erected much later by the pharaoh Thutmose in the 13th century BC. An incomplete inscription on the stele connects ‘Khaf’ to the Sphinx, but is missing the ‘re’ syllable to complete the Pharaoh’s name.</p><p>This one ambiguous partial reference, made over a thousand years later, is the best evidence Egyptology can give us for the origins of the Sphinx. The world’s most famous monumental sculpture is a mute beacon from the distant past, staring out into eternity, defying us to explain it.</p><p>But that began to change in the early 1990s when a new generation of investigators, outside of the insular world of Egyptology, began to study the Great Sphinx. What they would find would rip up the history books.</p><p>John Anthony West, an American author, and lecturer had stood in the shadow of the Sphinx many times, entranced by its strange power and beauty. For West, the mainstream consensus about its origins was unconvincing, he was sure the monument itself was telling a very different story.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/sphinx-19th-century.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Sphinx in the 19th Century</div></figcaption></figure><p>Back in the 1980s, West has studied the work of French Egyptologist and occultist R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz. Inside one of his books, a dense and esoteric study of Egyptian architecture and sculpture called Sacred Science, Schwaller de Lubicz made an intriguing observation.</p><p>The Great Sphinx at Giza looked like it had been eroded by water, rather than wind and sand. Although not a geologist, West could clearly see what Schwaller de Lubicz meant. The distinctive erosion patterns looked very different to the other old dynasty monuments in the Giza complex.</p><p>How could the Sphinx, a monument surrounded by desert, even buried under sand for much of its life, have been eroded by water? West was sure the Sphinx must be much older than previously thought, so old it had stood when Egypt’s climate was far wetter that it is today, more than 7,000 years ago.</p><p>Sensing he was on the threshold of a major breakthrough, but certain that mainstream Egyptology would be hostile to his ideas, West instead turned to science. Assembling a multidisciplinary team of geologists and geophysicists, the group took to Giza in 1990 to investigate further.</p><p>Dr. Robert A Schoch, a geologist at Boston University, studied the Sphinx and its surrounding structures for several months as part of West’s team. His conclusions would cause the biggest controversy in Egyptology in its history.</p><p>According to Schoch, the deep vertical erosion patterns on the Sphinx and its enclosure could only have been caused by water. To be precise, centuries of torrential rains pouring down on the monument. Such rainfall had not occurred at Giza since at least 5,000BC, if not earlier.</p><p>The implications of this were lost on nobody. 5,000BC was not only 2 and a half millennia before Khafre had lived, it was long before any advanced civilization was known to exist anywhere in the world.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/dr-robert-schoch.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Geologist Dr Robert Schoch (credit: Pirouettewp)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The Egyptological establishment was thrown into disarray. Dismissing the claims as ‘American hallucinations’ and calling West a charlatan, they even rubbished Schoch, a respected scientist. These initial reactions were clearly defensive and unedifying, but not unexpected.</p><p>Egyptology is not known for its tolerance to ideas from outside of its own discipline. In part, this is an inevitable consequence of the sheer number of fringe, bizarre and often outright crazy theories they have to deal with about the pyramids, that encompass everything from Atlantis to aliens.</p><p>But this was different. For the first time, hard science had intruded on their territory and it was trampling over all of its fundamental assumptions. If West and Schoch were right, the history of Egypt, and the whole ancient world would have to be rewritten.</p><p>Is the Great Sphinx of Giza really thousands of years older than previously thought?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>Testimony in stone</h3><p>In the early 1990s, geologist Robert Schoch was invited to Giza by John Anthony West to examine the weathering on the Sphinx. Although initially skeptical of the idea of an older Sphinx, Schoch soon came to concur with West’s theory.</p><p>The deep undulating vertical weathering patterns observed on the body of the Great Sphinx were, as far as Schoch was concerned, a textbook example of erosion caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall.</p><p>Schoch didn’t just study the external weathering on the body of the monument. Alongside geophysicist Dr. Thomas Dobecki, they carried out seismic studies around the statue, only to find the same distinctive rainfall induced weathering patterns in the subsurface bedrock.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/sphinx-eroision.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The distinctive undulating erosion patterns and old kingdom repairs visible on the side of the Sphinx (credit: kallerna)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Circumstantial evidence also emerged that appeared to confirm the team’s findings. Facing blocks thought to date from the Old Kingdom had been added to repair the Sphinx. Underneath, the same undulating weathering patterns were visible, indicating the repairs had been made when the Sphinx was already very ancient.</p><p>For Schoch, it was self-evident that the Sphinx had stood for millennia under heavy rainfall. Since it was widely agreed that such a climate had not existed in Egypt after about 5,000BC, either Schoch was wrong or the Sphinx was far older than the acknowledged start date for Egyptian, or any other, civilization.</p><p>In 1991, Schoch and West presented their initial findings to the American Geological Society, where they were positively received. But that would not be the case a year later when they debated representatives of mainstream Egyptology at the American Academy of Science.</p><p>By then, Schoch’s research had caused a major controversy in the world of archeology. Egyptologist Mark Lehner, acknowledged as the world’s foremost expert on the Sphinx, took particular umbrage at the idea the monument was far older than his own textbooks stated.</p><blockquote><span>\"I’m just following the science where it leads me, and it leads me to conclude that the Sphinx was built much earlier than previously thought\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>In front of a hall full of hundreds of people, Lehner was unable to properly engage Schoch’s scientific arguments, instead demanding to know where the other evidence was for an advanced civilization that far back in antiquity.</p><p>Schoch’s response was, not unreasonably, that it this was not his problem. “I’m just following the science where it leads me, and it leads me to conclude that the Sphinx was built much earlier than previously thought”, he later said.</p><p>In 1992, Schoch and Thomas Dobecki published their findings in the peer-reviewed journals Geoarchaeology and KMT, prompting a flurry of debate amongst academia.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/sphinx-buried-napoleonic-times.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Sphinx was buried under sand for much of its life</div></figcaption></figure><p>In response to Schoch’s evidence, some geologists offered alternative mechanisms to explain the erosion. James A. Harrell suggested the weathering was caused by moisture in the sand that had covered the Sphinx’s body for 4/5th of its existence.</p><p>However, Robert Schoch and other geologists dismissed this mechanism because it did not reflect the irregular nature of the erosion, which was concentrated in the areas most likely to be affected by rain run-off.</p><p>Schoch and West’s idea for an older Sphinx has also received some support from other geologists, although not all agree on the dates involved.</p><p>A British geologist, Colin Reader agrees with Schoch that the erosion on the Sphinx is due to rainfall but proposes a different mechanism that allows for the weathering to occur more rapidly.</p><p>Reader’s research, published in Archaeometry in 2001, was well received. But even though Reader’s conclusions are much more conservative than Schoch, he still pushes the date of the Sphinx back 500 years, which proved to be deeply unpalatable to Egyptologists.</p><p>Another geologist also backs Schoch’s basic theory but disagrees about the dating. David Coxill, writing in InScription: Journal of Ancient Egypt in 1998, contends the Sphinx must have been weathered by rainfall and pushes the dating back to before 3,000BC, although he was reluctant to go back as far as Schoch and West.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/rainfall-erosion-sphinx.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Other geologists agree with Schoch that the erosion on the Sphinx was caused by rainfall</div></figcaption></figure><p>Egyptologists, however, continue to ignore the geological evidence, deciding instead to concentrate on the historical and archeological context to try and counter the case for an older Sphinx.</p><p>Where, they ask, is the evidence for an advanced civilization before 5,000BC? As Mark Lehner said when debating Robert Schoch,  “If the Sphinx was built by an earlier culture, where is the evidence of that civilization? Where are the pottery shards? People during that age were hunters and gatherers. They didn’t build cities”.</p><h3>Echoes of the past</h3><p>Barely a decade after Mark Lehner spoke those words, his strident convictions about early civilization would be upturned in the most comprehensive way possible.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/gobekli-tepe.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Göbekli Tepe has caused archeologists to reassess early civilization (credit: Teomancimit)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Göbekli Tepe, an extraordinary archeological site still been excavated in southeast Turkey, challenges all of our assumptions about mankind’s early history. A massive ancient temple complex, it consists of hundreds of monolithic T-shaped pillars, some weighing up to 15 tons, arranged into a series of stone circles and enclosures.</p><p>Most of the pillars contain beautiful carvings of animals, such as snakes, leopards, foxes, birds, and scorpions. These reliefs and the workmanship of the pillars attest to a high degree of sophistication and artistry from their creators, thought to be even higher than that demonstrated at Stonehenge.</p><p>Archeologists agree that Göbekli Tepe must be the product of an organized society, with teams of artisans, builders and planners required for its construction. But what’s so astonishing about it is the dating of the site, an incredible 10,000BC.</p><p>To put that into some kind of context, it’s 6000 years older than Stonehenge, a staggering 7000 years older than the mainstream dating of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids of Giza and even thousands of years older than Robert Schoch’s controversial dating of the Sphinx.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/gobekli-tepe-carvings.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">One of the many carvings of animals on the pillars at Göbekli Tepe (credit: Klaus-Peter Simon)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Göbekli Tepe demonstrates that human beings were capable of monolithic masonry and sophisticated sculpture so far into the mists of prehistory that they were as further removed from the Ancient Egyptians than that great civilization is from us today.</p><p>Back in the 1990s, Egyptologists dismissed John Antony West and Robert Schoch’s theory that the Sphinx dated from before 5000BC because they couldn’t, they said, show them the pottery of such a civilization.</p><p>Göbekli Tepe goes far beyond just pottery.</p><h3>Mistaken identity</h3><p>Another argument used to support the traditional, 2500BC dating of the Sphinx and its attribution to the old kingdom pharaoh Khafre, is a diorite statue of the pharaoh found close by to the Sphinx.</p><p>According to mainstream egyptology, the statue of Khafre bears a distinct resemblance to the face on the Sphinx, demonstrating that it was indeed a monument built to celebrate the pharaoh.</p><p>But does the Sphinx really look like Khafre? Clearly this was always a subjective argument, some see the similarity whilst others see no likeness at all. Again showing his flair for lateral thinking, John Anthony West decided to test the theory using forensic science.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/sphinx-face.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A forensic artist found that the face of the Great Sphinx was not that of Khafre (credit: Dennis Jarvis)</div></figcaption></figure><p>West enlisted police artist Frank Domingo to study the face of the Sphinx. Domingo had spent 20 years creating photofits, sketching potential suspects and preparing facial reconstructions for the New York Police Department.</p><p>Domingo and his assistant traveled to Giza and took hundreds of photographs of the Sphinx and the Khafre statute that was supposed to resemble it. If the two artworks really represented the same person, Domingo was the man to find out.</p><p>Comparing the facial structure and key reference points such as eyes, noses and ears, Domingo was able to make a clear judgment. “After reviewing my various drawings, schematics, and measurements, my final conclusion concurs with my initial reaction: the two works represent two separate individuals”, Domingo stated.</p><p>“The proportions in the frontal view and especially the angles and facial protrusion in the lateral views, convinced me that the Sphinx is not Khafre. If the ancient Egyptians were skilled technicians and capable of duplicating images, then these two works cannot represent the same individual”.</p><p>If Domingo is right, then clearly the Sphinx does not depict Khafre. If it does, then the resemblance is too poor to be used as a determination of anything. Either way, the visual evidence for the conventional dating of the Sphinx is perhaps the weakest of that offered by Egyptologists.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Context</h3><p>The main argument mainstream Egyptologists use to counter the idea of an older Sphinx is the archeological context between the statue and surrounding monuments on the Giza plateau.</p><p>Mark Lehner, the world’s leading authority on the Sphinx, contends that and the nearby Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple are related to the Sphinx, part of a larger funerary complex built by the pharaoh, Khafre.</p><p>Each monument shows a clear archeological sequence, where newer works are built incorporating older structures or constructed around them. This ‘order’ argument strongly suggests, at least to Lehner, that all of the monuments are contemporary to Khafre.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/valley-temple-sphinx.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Archeologists think the Valley Temple predates the Sphinx (credit: HoremWeb)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Lehner also believes the complex of monuments and temples at Giza were constructed to worship the sun god Re, offering astronomical alignments between them as further evidence.</p><p>For instance, a line drawn through the Sphinx Temple’s east-west axis passes along the right side of the Sphinx and carries on to the southside of Khafre’s pyramid. Twice a year at the equinoxes, the sun sets on this alignment, something unlikely to occur by chance and indicating a deliberate intent on the part its builders.</p><p>Geological evidence cited by Egyptologists also shows that the Sphinx, the Sphinx Temple, and the Khafre Valley Temple were all quarried from the same rock, although the sequence argument seems to indicate the Valley Temple was built first.</p><p>If that is the case, then the Sphinx is younger than the Valley temple. And if that is the case, then the argument for an older Sphinx becomes much more problematic because now several other monuments, more reliably dated to Khafre, have to be dragged into the much earlier era proposed by West and Schoch.</p><p>Ultimately this amounts to a clash of two very different sciences. At one end, we have the hard science of geology. Geology is rigorous, it can be tested by experiment, it can be shown to be false.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-great-sphinx-enigma-in-the-sands/sphinx-eastern-horizon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Sphinx has looked out to the eastern horizon for millennia</div></figcaption></figure><p>Archeology is a social science.

The affair is closed and involves no witches, black magic or moonlight rites…”</p><p>Byford-Jones was naturally intrigued. Whoever wrote those words clearly had first-hand knowledge of what had happened. After subsequent correspondence, Anna revealed herself to be Una Mossop and told the full story.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hagley-woods-mystery-bella-in-the-wych-elm/fritz-lang-ministry-of-fear-1941.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was Bella a Nazi spy?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Her husband Jack had worked at a local munitions factory in the early 1940s and had come into some money after meeting a mysterious Dutchman.</p><p>Jack later admitted to Una that the Dutchman was a Nazi agent. Jack had been passing him information about local industrial sites, which in turn was passed to another agent posing as a cabaret performer at local theatres.</p><p>The Midlands had been bombarded by the Luftwaffe in the early 40s and such information would have been invaluable for the Nazis to target their raids where they would do the most damage to Britain’s war effort.</p><p>One day Jack met his contact at a pub close to Hagley Wood. He was arguing with a Dutch Woman. He ordered Jack drive them both out to the Clent Hills, but the argument had grown extremely violent and the Dutch agent strangled the woman in the car.</p><p>Fearing for his own life, Jack helped carry the body into nearby Hagley Wood, where the pair buried it in the hollow of the old elm tree.</p><p>Una’s husband was apparently so traumatized by the brutal murder of Bella that he had a nervous breakdown, tormented by horrific visions of a woman’s skull in a tree. Jack was institutionalized in 1941 and apparently died later that year.</p><p>The timescales fitted quite well with Bella’s death. The pathologist had estimated it was about 18 months prior to the bodies discovery, which would have placed it in the middle of 1941.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hagley-woods-mystery-bella-in-the-wych-elm/midlands-bombsite-ww2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Midlands was a major target for the Nazi Luftwaffe during the war</div></figcaption></figure><p>The information Una gave Byford-Jones was convincing enough that the police and MI5 got involved. According to the journalist, they verified some details of Una’s account but were unable to find any of the remaining perpetrators.</p><p>With the involvement of the intelligence services, some have speculated there may have been a cover-up over the investigation of the information. Just 8 years after the war, details of spy rings may have still been classified.</p><p>The cover-up theory was also bolstered by the curious fact that Bella’s remains had gone missing, precluding any further forensic examinations.</p><p>The story faded back into semi-obscurity. An occasional piece of graffiti would briefly revive interest, but there were no new leads for another 15 years and a book by historian Donald McCormick.</p><p>McCormick’s ‘Murder by Witchcraft’, despite its name, built upon the spy ring theory. McCormick had obtained Abwehr files, the records of German Military intelligence.</p><p>According to McCormick’s information, A Nazi agent by the name of Lehrer was operating in the Midlands in 1941 and he had a Dutch girlfriend living in Birmingham called Clarabella Dronkers.</p><p>Was Clarabella the Bella found in the wych elm? Like Bella, she was about 30 years old and like Bella, she apparently had crooked teeth.</p><p>What’s especially suggestive about the identification is that a real Nazi spy was captured in mid-1942 and executed at Wandsworth prison on New Year's Eve that year. His name was Johannes Marinus Dronkers.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hagley-woods-mystery-bella-in-the-wych-elm/ray-milland-ministry-of-fear.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was there a spy ring operating in the area?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Was Bella this Dutch spy’s wife? The wedding ring found with her body lends credence to the idea. And if Bella was a foreigner, it would explain why no trace of her could be found in England.</p><p>It’s possible that some kind of love triangle had developed amongst the agents, or that Bella had grown loose lipped and risked revealing their existence to the British authorities.</p><p>Whilst the exact nature of the operation and how this tangle of names and relationships fit together remains unclear, the notion that Bella was involved in some way with a spy ring seems quite convincing.</p><p>Further tidbits support the idea. There were several reports in 1940/41 of the Home Guard been alerted to possible agents parachuting into the area around Clent Hill and Hagley Wood.</p><p>Furthermore, a former British soldier told author Ian Topham that he saw Nazi files detailing agents that were operating in the Midlands. One operative matching Bella’s description was codenamed Clara, and had parachuted into the area in 1941.</p><h3>The cabaret singer</h3><p>In recent years, newly declassified MI5 files from the war have shed some fresh light on the spy-ring theory.</p><p>One file details the arrest and interrogation of a Czech-born Gestapo agent named Josef Jakobs. Jakobs, who had the dubious distinction of been the last man to be executed at the tower of London, was captured after parachuting into Cambridgeshire in 1941.</p><p>Found on Jakobs person was a photograph of a young woman. She was a cabaret singer and German movie star called Clara Bauerle. According to Jakobs, she had also been recruited by the Gestapo as a secret agent.</p><p>Jakobs information checked out, Bauerle was a German cabaret singer and tellingly, had worked in Birmingham for several years before the war and had even developed a convincing local accent. She would have been an ideal candidate for a spy.</p><p>According to Jakobs, she was due to follow him into England, although after his capture he thought it unlikely this had happened. But the timings made sense.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hagley-woods-mystery-bella-in-the-wych-elm/clara-bauerle-josef-jakobs-bella.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The photograph of Clara Bauerle found in Josef Jacobs’ possession.

If she was not Bella in the wych elm, what had happened to her?</p><p>It’s not too much of a stretch to see how Clara Bauerle may have been remembered as Clara Bella to English audiences. Perhaps someone had even recognised her from her pre-war days in Birmingham.</p><p>The risk of Clara been exposed as a German in England during the middle of the war may have threatened the spy ring she had been involved in. Could it have led to her been permanently silenced and left to haunt those dark woods at Hagley?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Loose ends</h3><p>One reason that might tend against the spy theory is the method of death. Bella was found deep in private woodland in an overgrown wych elm tree.</p><p>It’s hard to understand why anyone, least of all a foreign spy unfamiliar with the locale, would choose this as a burial site. How would they even know such a tree existed?</p><p>There are also loose ends with the spy theory. None of the remaining members of the ring were ever found, despite extensive searches. Even today, with wartime records declassified, very little light has been shed on the putative spy ring.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hagley-woods-mystery-bella-in-the-wych-elm/hagley-woods.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The woodland where Bella’s body was discovered (credit: Keith Bloomfield)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Recently discovered MI5 documents have prompted the theory that Bella may have been Josef Jakobs’ girlfriend Clara Bauerle, but this idea has some significant flaws.</p><p>Pathologist James Webster listed Bella’s height as 5ft, whereas Bauerle was known to be quite a tall woman. And online databases of German musical performers list Bauerle death as 1942, which if accurate would rule her out as Bella.</p><p>Other less exotic theories have been suggested over the years. Bella was a prostitute murdered by an angry john or a local barmaid killed by an American GI. More far-fetched was that she was a gypsy killed in an occult ritual.</p><p>It’s doubtful we’ll ever know what really happened at Hagley Wood. But perhaps there is still someone out there, by now very old, carrying a dark secret?</p><p>A few years ago some graffiti appeared on the 200-year-old Wychbury obelisk at Hagley Hall.

Highgate Cemetery was by then over 100 years old and had fallen into disrepair and decay.</p><p>Overgrown and sprawling, the gothic Victorian graveyard seemed the perfect setting for the strange and sinister events that would follow.</p><p>One night in 1963, a couple were walking home down Swain’s Lane, which passed along cemetery’s north gate.

A man walking his dog saw the same tall dark figure sliding over the wall along Swain’s Lane like ‘black treacle’.</p><p>By 1969, the reports from Highgate would pique the interest of David Farrant, a young Wicca enthusiast and member of the British Occult Society.</p><p>Farrant, along with ‘Bishop’ Sean Manchester, would become the 2 figures most associated with the case. The pair’s antics over the next few years are now infamous, and the ensuing feud sparked between them lasts to this day.</p><p>David Farrant had first heard about the sightings in the late 60s and decided to investigate for himself. One winter’s night in December 1969 Farrant camped out in the graveyard. He immediately hit ghostly pay dirt.</p><p>Farrant witnessed a very tall, dark figure, with piercing hypnotic eyes. The air around him had suddenly turned icy cold. This seemed to be the same entity he had heard about.</p><p>The local newspaper in Highgate — the Hampstead and Highgate Express, had become interested in the sightings. In particular, the reports of Satanists performing black magic and sacrificing animals at the cemetery.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/highgate-vampire-newspaper.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Farrant’s ‘vampire hunting’ exploits were reported in the local press</div></figcaption></figure><p>The publicity attracted the attention of Sean Manchester, an eccentric and flamboyant figure that claimed to be a bishop in an obscure church. Not only was he a bishop, according to Manchester, he was also a vampire hunter.</p><p>In an interview with the Hampstead and Highgate Express in February 1970, Manchester claimed the figure was a ‘King Vampire’, an undead 15th century Romanian nobleman who had practised black magic in Wallachia,  the home of Dracula himself.</p><p>Travelling to England, he had somehow ended up buried in what would become Highgate. Manchester told the paper that the vampire had been revived by the activity of the Satanists that were said to operate at the cemetery.</p><p>Here then, was born the legend of the Highgate Vampire.</p><p>In March 1970, Farrant and Manchester would both be interviewed about the sightings by the ITV News on the fitting date of Friday the 13th.</p><p>Manchester repeated his florid account of the King Vampire, and after goading Farrant, said he would personally be leading a vampire hunt at Highgate that very night.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/highgate-cemetery-disrepair-1970s.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Highgate Cemetery had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s</div></figcaption></figure><p>A mob of people, in scenes reminiscent of a Hammer Horror film, soon descended on the cemetery.

Several of those that took part did, however, report seeing a strange dark figure in the grounds of the cemetery.</p><p>Farrant and Manchester continued to investigate Highgate and its supposed Vampire. Farrant was even arrested later in 1970 near the cemetery carrying a crucifix and wooden stake.</p><p>In the years that followed, the pair would publish numerous books about the affair and their rivalry would grow more bitter.</p><p>In 1985, Manchester self-published his book ‘The Highgate Vampire’. In it, he sensationally claimed to have hunted the vampire for a further 13 years, before finally staking, beheading and burning it.</p><p>Manchester had consigned the ungodly being to hell.

Jure Grando, a Croatian peasant, died in 1656 and became one of the first historical figures to be described as a vampire.</p><p>Grando was said to have come back to life as a blood-sucking undead corpse to terrorise the residents of his village. He was eventually put to rest after a plucky village cut his head off, a stake through the heart having failed to stop his rampage.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/medieval-bulgarian-vampire.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A medieval Bulgarian skeleton found with a metal spike through its heart</div></figcaption></figure><p>During the 18th century, a number of supposed vampire outbreaks caused widespread panic in Prussia and Serbia. Exhumations and stakings became common.</p><p>News of this vampire hysteria filtered through to Germany and England and inspired some of the earliest vampire fiction, such as Heinrich August Ossenfelder’s poem ‘The Vampire’ and Elizabeth Caroline Grey novel ‘The Skeleton Count, or The Vampire Mistress’.</p><p>In 1897, Irish author Bram Stoker’s ‘Dracula’ was published and would become the definitive account of the modern vampire legend.</p><p>Stoker’s book established many of the common tropes we recognise today — his vampire had no reflection, he could change shape into an animal, he spawned vampire brides and he would have an archenemy , Van Helsing.</p><p>Dracula would go on to inspire innumerable films, books, tv shows and other media, and it seems, the principal players in the Highgate vampire saga.</p><p>Beyond fiction, many attempts have been made to find real world explanations for ‘vampires’.</p><p>In 1985, Canadian biochemist David Dolphin suggested a rare blood disease called porphyria may be the real source behind vampire legends.</p><p>Porphyria sufferers lack a vital pigment in their blood, and Dolphin suggested the ingestion of blood in vampire lore may be an attempt to replace this.</p><p>Furthermore, porphyria sufferers can be acutely sensitivity to light, to the extent that their skin can blister and burn in sunlight.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/carl-laemmle-dracula-1931.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Dracula has had an immense impact on popular culture</div></figcaption></figure><p>Spanish neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso had an alternative explanation. In 1998, he noted that the symptoms of vampirism bore a striking resemblance to rabies.</p><p>Rabies sufferers can become hypersensitive to light, water and strong odours such as garlic. The disease attacks the central nervous system often leading to the victim becoming demented, nocturnal, and even hypersexual -  all qualities associated with vampires.</p><p>Rabies can also cause spasming that forces the victims to cough up blood. Rather than undead demons, could vampires simply be rabies sufferers?</p><p>Gomez-Alonso found another interesting coincidence to back up his theory. Many of the famous vampire panics of 17th-century Eastern Europe coincided with rabies outbreaks.</p><p>Other suggested medical causes for vampirism are pellagra, a chronic shortage of niacin that causes the victims to blister in sunlight, and tuberculosis, which causes pale skin and red swollen eyes and lips.</p><p>Perhaps the most compelling real-world explanation for vampirism isn’t physical though, but psychological.</p><p>Blood drinking and other vampiric rituals are a feature of many psychopathic and serial murderers. Richard Trenton Chase was nicknamed ‘The Vampire Killer’ because he drank his victims blood and ate their remains.</p><p>Fritz Haarmann,  ‘The Vampire of Hanover’, murdered 24 boys in Germany in the years following WW1. His preferred killing method was biting into their necks and throats.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/fritz-haarmann-vampire.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Fritz Haarmann killed by biting his victim’s necks</div></figcaption></figure><p>90-year-old Mabel Leyshon was stabbed to death at her home in Anglesey, Wales, in November 2001.

Or, as some suspected, were the psychopaths the ones doing the hunting?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>A Toothless Monster</h3><p>Whilst there were many sightings of ghostly apparitions in and around Highgate Cemetery dating back to its construction, most of them were decidedly un-vampiric in nature.</p><p>Reports were diverse and inconsistent;  a man in a hat, a white lady, a phantom cyclist, a paddling figure in a pond, a woman pushed over in the dark and noises such as bells and voices.</p><p>It wasn’t until the two central characters in the story, David Farrant and Sean Manchester, entered the fray that there was any suggestion of vampires.</p><p>Between them, they have written numerous books about the affair, and developed a bitter rivalry that continues into the age of the internet. But perhaps the thing they have most in common is the complete lack of evidence they provide for their claims.</p><p>There is and remains nothing, beyond the theatrical antics of the two men to suggest there was ever any kind of vampire prowling the decaying tombs of Highgate.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-highgate-vampire-horror-of-the-dead/highgate-cemetery-victorian-times.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Reports of hauntings date back to Victorian times, but they were always un-vampire like</div></figcaption></figure><p>Today, Farrant says he does not believe what he refers to as ‘the entity’ was a vampire at all.

Finding only empty coffins, he placed garlic and holy water around them to ward the monster off from returning.</p><p>Having apparently escaped his grasp, the vampire hunter then recounts his 13-year quest to hunt down and destroy the evil creature, eventually tracking it to an eerie, abandoned old house in London’s Crouch End.</p><p>Finding the vampire in its coffin, like a real life Van Helsing, Manchester says he kicked the lid off its casket, staked it through the heart and burnt the body, finally condemning the accursed creature to hell.</p><p>If this wasn’t enough, Manchester capped his tale with an audacious flourish.

Hitler’s Nazi party were in power in Germany and WW2 was brewing. Both countries were keen to quickly close the book on the Hindenburg incident.</p><p>But many were unconvinced by the conclusions. Some of the surviving crew members thought the Hindenburg had been downed by sabotage.</p><p>The airship had come to embody the Nazi party. Hitler had financed its construction and used it at the 1936 Olympics. It even had swastikas, the emblem of the Nazi party, on its tail.</p><p>The Zeppelin company had also been warned by the Gestapo of a specific threat to the ship, and plainclothes intelligence officers were on board in search of potential saboteurs.</p><p>Had the Hindenburg been brought down by opponents of Hitler? The ships commander, Max Pruss, thought so. He suspected a passenger or crewmember with anti-Nazi affiliations.</p><p>The ships destruction certainly represented a blow for the Nazis. It effectively shut down the airship industry, then dominated by the Germans.</p><p>It also represented an embarrassment to a country that prided itself on its technological and engineering excellence.</p><p>Was the Hindenburg disaster a terrorist attack aimed at undermining the Nazi regime?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>Safety record</h3><p>There were 22 photographers and cameramen at Lakehurst when the Hindenburg exploded. They comprehensively captured the whole disaster in a series of famous photographs and films.</p><p>Yet none of them captured the spark of static electricity that was said to have caused the explosion. Many of those involved with the ship were also skeptical of the spark theory.</p><p>Commander Pruss, the ships captain, never believed the theory. He pointed out how he had taken the ship through thunderstorms in the past, and even witnessed it been struck by lightning.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hindenburg-disaster-terror-at-lakehurst/graf-zeppelin.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Zeppelin’s fleet of airships had an impeccable safety record</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hydrogen on its own, when sealed away from the air as it was in the Hindenburg, is not flammable.

He told the FBI he believed the Hindenburg had been sabotaged.</p><p>Rosendahl had discussed the matter with Zeppelin boss Hugo Eckener. Eckener had come out as a proponent of the spark theory but privately told Rosendahl he believed the ship had been sabotaged.</p><p>Eckener had interviewed the whole crew and had learnt of their suspicions about a passenger called Joseph Späh.</p><p>One steward felt Späh had been acting oddly. He was aloof and did not mix with the other passengers. He was heard to express his dislike of airships and make anti-Nazi comments.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hindenburg-disaster-terror-at-lakehurst/hugo-eckener-and-rosendahl.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Hugo Eckener, center right and Commander Rosendahl, right.</div></figcaption></figure><p>He also had the opportunity to have planted a bomb. He had 2 dogs leashed up in a restricted area near where the explosion was thought to have originated and was seen to venture into the area to tend to the dogs.</p><p>This was against the rules and Späh was reprimanded for his behaviour on several occasions. Rosendahl felt Späh may have sabotaged the ship during one of these covert visits.</p><p>Späh was an acrobat so could have climbed into the rigging to place some kind of timer device to ignite vented hydrogen gas in the area.</p><p>If Späh had set a timer to trigger an explosion, he may have intended it to do so after the passengers had left the ship, as he was observed becoming particularly agitated when the ships landing was delayed.</p><h3>Erich Spehl</h3><p>One piece of physical evidence to support the sabotage theory was residue from a small dry battery found in the wreckage by the New York bomb squad.</p><p>It was the kind of battery that could have powered a camera flash, something that could conceivably have been used as part of an incendiary device.</p><p>This lead to crew member Erich Spehl coming under suspicion. Spehl was known to be a keen amateur photographer and would have had access to such batteries.</p><p>Some witnesses to the explosion remember seeing a bright flash in the area where it started.

The FBI quickly dropped its investigation of Späh due to lack of evidence.</p><p>His agitation when he learned the ship’s landing would be delayed could easily be attributed to the fact he had spent months away from his family and was keen to be reunited with them.</p><p>The other suggested saboteur, Erich Spehl, was largely suspected on the basis of the battery residue found in the wreckage.</p><p>However, there was no evidence that this was found anywhere near the source of the explosion. No other evidence for a bomb or incendiary was found in the wreckage either.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hindenburg-disaster-terror-at-lakehurst/hindenburg-wreckage.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">No evidence of a bomb or incendiary was found in the wreckage</div></figcaption></figure><p>Like Späh, the case against Spehl was circumstantial and nothing solid linked him to any genuine plot.</p><p>Unlike Späh, who survived the disaster and was deeply upset by rumours he was responsible, Spehl died and was unable to defend himself.</p><h3>The spark</h3><p>Both of the original inquiries concluded that the disaster was caused by a spark that ignited leaking hydrogen. Most experts today tend to side with this theory.</p><p>In 2013, aeronautical engineers at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas launched their own investigation into the disaster.</p><p>The researchers tested all of the suggested scenarios using scale models of the Hindenburg. They also studied archive footage and found crucial new witnesses to the disaster.</p><p>One witness, Mark Heald, was 8 years old in 1937. Heald viewed the explosion from a different vantage point to most of the other witnesses and recalled seeing a blue fire near the rudder of the craft.</p><p>This confirmed the suspicions of the investigators. The blue light was St Elmo’s fire, an electrostatic plasma caused by thunderstorms. The stormy weather had caused a massive build up of static electricity at the rear of the ship.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-hindenburg-disaster-terror-at-lakehurst/hindenburg-nazi-1936.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Hindenburg moored at Lakehurst in 1936</div></figcaption></figure><p>When the Hindenburg’s mooring ropes were lowered, this effectively earthed the craft.

James and Dorothy L Sayers, found the strange 1931 death of the Liverpool housewife just as baffling.  But for all the mystery surrounding the circumstances of the crime, it is perhaps chief suspect William Herbert Wallace that remains the biggest conundrum of all.</p><p>The 52-year-old insurance salesman seemed strangely agitated as he rode the tram to his destination that dark winter evening on January 20th 1931. Wallace was looking for an address he had never heard of before and, whether deliberately or not, his behaviour was ensuring he would be remembered.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wallace-portrait.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">William Herbert Wallace, the unknowable insurance salesman</div></figcaption></figure><p>The tram's conductor recalled how Wallace repeatedly pestered him and his ticket inspector to alert him where to get off. When he eventually pointed Wallace to the correct stop, he seemed particularly keen to impart to the conductor - \"I am a complete stranger around here\".</p><p>On alighting, Wallace struggled to find the house he was seeking. Did 25 Menlove Gardens East even exist? Was he on a wild goose chase? If the suspicion had entered Wallace's thoughts, he had good reason considering the unusual way the appointment had been made.</p><p>A local cafe where he attended a chess club had received a call for him by phone the previous night, January 19th, the caller giving his name as R. M. Qualtrough. Although Wallace only attended the chess club sporadically, the caller appeared to know he would be there that night and left a message for him with chess club captain Samuel Beattie, asking to meet regarding insurance business. </p><p>Wallace had never heard of Qualtrough and had never received an unsolicited call like this at his chess club before. But 1931 was straitened times for depression-era Britain and he elected to keep the appointment, scenting there may be some valuable commission in it for him. The message directed Wallace to meet Qualtrough at 25 Menlove Gardens East the following night at 7:30pm.</p><p>And here he was, lost in the Liverpool night trying to find an address that seemed not to exist. He had asked the tram conductors, he had stopped people in the street, he had consulted street directories in newsagents, he even stopped a policeman and recounted to him the whole strange saga. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/3581-bank-cottle-cafe.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The call was received at the cafe were Wallace sometimes played chess</div></figcaption></figure><p>On each occasion, Wallace had made a particular show of mentioning what time he was due to meet this Qualtrough. Was this a cunning murderer’s attempt to lay himself a watertight alibi, as some believe, or a flustered insurance salesman failing to make an appointment on time? </p><p>It turns out there are lots of Menlove Gardens in Liverpool - North, South, and West. East, however, remains conspicuous by its absence, a fact that was no doubt the subject of local jokes. Whoever had made that call appeared to be pulling Wallace's leg, sending him on a fruitless search for a fictional address.</p><p>Was this merely a prank or something more sinister? As the 7:30pm appointment evaporated into the night, and with no sign of his destination, Wallace eventually gave up and decided to return home.</p><p>It was around 8:45pm when John and Florence Johnston, Wallace's next door neighbours, saw him outside of his house at 29 Wolverton Street. He was looking perturbed, telling them both the front and back door were locked and would not open. Seemingly concerned, he asked the couple - \"Have you heard anything unusual tonight?\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/backyard.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The backdoor where Wallace's neighbours observed him struggling with the lock</div></figcaption></figure><p>The neighbours followed Wallace back to the rear of his house and watched on as he tried the back door lock one more time. Oddly, this time it worked and Wallace entered the house. As the Johnstons waited outside, Wallace lit a lamp and moved carefully around the house. A few moments later he stepped back outside and said flatly - \"Oh come and see, she's been killed\".</p><p>To the Johnston's horror, Julia Wallace was laid out in front of the gas fire in the front room, violently battered to death, blood splatter splashed across the walls. \"They've finished her, look at her brains\", a ghostly pale Wallace muttered. </p><p>Back in the kitchen, Wallace noticed the locked cupboard where he kept his insurance collection money had been wrenched open and the four pounds inside had been stolen. Was this a robbery that had turned to murder? If so it looked a targeted one, the house had not been ransacked and nothing else had been taken, including the money from Julia's handbag which rested on the kitchen table.</p><p>At this point John Johnston took charge, ordering his wife and Wallace to stay in the house and touch nothing whilst he fetched the police and a doctor, the latter clearly a futile gesture considering the grisly state of Julia's body in the room next door.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/julia-wallace-crime-scene.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Police photograph of Julia Wallace's battered corpse. But who was the culprit?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Twenty-five minutes later the first of a cavalcade of officers from the Merseyside Police arrived at the Wallace home. It's fair to say their handling of the case over the next few days left much to be desired; the force had been seriously weakened by a major strike in 1919 that had led half of its staff to be dismissed, those remaining often filling in roles they were not properly qualified or experienced for. </p><p>The first officers on the scene, PC Fred Williams and Police Sergeant Breslin, made a cursory search of the property. It looked like someone had briefly rifled around in the bedroom, but the rest of the house appeared undisturbed. The officers made one important observation - underneath Julia's body was a partially burnt Macintosh coat. Had this belonged to the killer or was Julia wearing it when she was attacked?</p><p>During the next hour, a pressman from the Liverpool Daily Post arrived to do double duty as the police photographer, and John Edward Whitly MacFall, a lecturer of Forensic Medicine at Liverpool University called to act as the police's forensics expert. MacFall's role would prove to be the most contentious, with many commentators feeling he bungled the chance to gather the most vital piece of evidence - the time of death.</p><p>Even in 1931, using the cadaver's rigor mortis alone to determine how long someone had been dead was out of date. But that's exactly what MacFall did, stating his opinion that Julia had died at about 8pm, 45 minutes before Wallace returned home, based on the body's stiffness. MacFall would later change his mind on the time of death, despite no other tests been conducted. </p><p>A more detailed examination of the body revealed that Julia had been beaten severely about the head with a blunt object, the most severe blows occurring around the left ear were brain tissue could be seen protruding from the skull. The fatal blows were probably inflicted whilst  she lay face down on the floor in front of the fire. Police believed she must have brushed the fire as she fell due to the singeing of her dress and the partial burning of the Macintosh coat.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wallace-toilet.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A small clot of blood was found on the toilet but proved to be inconclusive</div></figcaption></figure><p>Detective Superintendent Hubert Rory Moore arrived next, slightly the worse for wear after an evening in the pub. Like any good policeman, drunk or not, Moore had his eye on Wallace himself as the likely suspect. But there was also the possibility that the crime was the work of the Anfield Housebreaker, a burglar that had plagued the local area in the previous months. Perhaps one of his robberies had resulted in fatal consequences for Julia Wallace? </p><p>Whoever the culprit, so frenzied was the attack that it was obvious they must have been covered in blood. Splatter had sprayed around the whole room, blood drizzling the walls seven feet high. An examination of the house's drains and sinks revealed they had not been used that evening, so the assailant must have fled the property drenched in his victims blood.</p><p>A more thorough search of the house, yard and surrounding area could uncover no trace of a murder weapon. The Wallace's cleaner would tell police a thin metal fire poker and an iron bar from the parlor were missing. Was one of these the murder weapon?</p><p>Meanwhile, a subdued Wallace sat in his kitchen and calmly explained to Hubert Moore and the other detectives the strange circumstances of his evening, how he had been lured on a wild goose chase around Menlove Gardens by the chess club phone call from R. M Qualtrough. Around midnight he was taken to the police station to make a formal statement, stating - \"I have no suspicion of anyone\".</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wolverton-street-1931.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Wallace's house on Wolveton Street in Anfield, Liverpool</div></figcaption></figure><p>In the following days, police began to develop some contradictory evidence regarding Wallace's involvement in his wife's death. A switchboard supervisor at the Liverpool telephone exchange had narrowed the call to the chess club to a phone booth just 400 yards from Wallace's house in Wolverton Street. </p><p>Tellingly, this booth was adjacent to where Wallace had caught the tram to his chess club the night before the murder. And it was shortly before he had arrived at the chess club that the telephone message had been received. To police, this looked like too much of a coincidence; had Wallace placed the call himself in order to provide himself with an alibi for the murder?</p><p>The suspicions against Wallace appeared to be crystallising. He and his wife were, by all accounts, a strange couple; he was frequently ill with kidney troubles and she was described by their few friends as fastidious and peculiar. A former friend characterized their marriage as strained and lacking in feeling. Had Wallace finally snapped and decided to rid himself of his difficult wife?</p><p>Police had also noted Wallace's strange demeanor, especially how he had made such a fuss on the tram and around Menlove Gardens, and the number of people had had stopped and asked for directions.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/anfield-1627.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The enigmatic R.

Was Wallace ensuring that he would have witnesses when the body was discovered?</p><p>Despite Wallace becoming the prime suspect, the reconstruction of the times surrounding the murder looked to be exculpatory for him. He was firmly placed on the tram to Menlove Gardens at 7:06pm, and several witnesses had come forward to state they had seen Julia alive between 6:30pm and 6:45pm. This would only have given Wallace a window of around fifteen minutes to kill his wife, clean himself up, change his clothes and go catch his tram.</p><p>It looked extremely unlikely Wallace could have done it in time. Police did try to increase the window of opportunity he might have had by staging a reenactment with a young officer sprinting from Wolverton Street to the tram stop, but it was obvious the ailing 52-year old insurance salesman was not capable of such a feat.</p><p>Whoever Qualtrough was, and whatever the purpose of the call, it had succeeded in providing Wallace with an almost cast iron alibi. The problem was, it didn't look like anyone else could have committed the crime either. No weapon, no suspects, no witnesses and the body found in a locked house; whoever had killed Julia appeared to have pulled off the perfect crime.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wallace-appeal.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">William Herbert Wallace walks out of the appeal court a free man</div></figcaption></figure><p>It's no wonder the great mystery writers were so enamoured with the case, it would have made a classic story by the likes of Agatha Christie or Dorothy L. Sayers. The aforementioned Raymond Chandler said of it - \"The Wallace case is the nonpareil of all murder mysteries...I call it the impossible murder because Wallace couldn’t have done it, and neither could anyone else.\"</p><p>Despite the paucity of solid evidence in the case, the police charged Wallace with the murder. At his short, four-day trial in April 1931, the prosecution tried to argue that the accused had committed the murder naked save for the Macintosh found beneath Julia's body, a salacious theory that made a particular impression in the court-room. The defense countered with the timings that seemed to be exculpatory for Wallace.</p><p>The defendant himself cut a lonely, impassive figure throughout, rarely showing any emotion. When called to the stand he spoke nervously but calmy, refusing to become flustered by the often aggressive questioning of the prosecution. </p><p>Some thought Wallace's demeanor was what sealed his fate with the jury, rather than the evidence. His round rimmed glasses, reminiscent of Dr. Crippen, probably didn't help either. Despite a feeling by most observers in the courtroom that the prosecution had failed to make their case, and despite the judge summing up favourably towards the defense, the jurors returned in just a few hours with a unanimous verdict - \"Guilty\".</p><blockquote><span>\"I am not guilty. I cannot say anything else.\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>\"You, William Herbert Wallace, have been convicted of murder upon the verdict of the jury.\", the court clerk announced. \"Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon you according to law?\" Wallace simply replied - \"I am not guilty. I cannot say anything else\".</p><p>Judge Robert Alderson Wright donned the customary black cap, perhaps somewhat reluctantly, and sentenced Wallace to the mandatory sentence of death by hanging.  There was little waiting on ceremony in 1930s England, and the provisional execution date, barring appeals, was penned in for just a months time in May 1931. That appeal, however, saved Wallace's life.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/man-they-did-not-hang.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sensational coverage in the press suggested Wallace had gotten away with murder</div></figcaption></figure><p>The following month at the Court of Criminal Appeal in London, Justice Gordon Hewart made the unprecedented move of overturning the guilty verdict. The case against Wallace was not - \"proved with that certainty which is necessary in order to justify a verdict of guilty\", he said. \"The result is that this appeal will be allowed and this conviction quashed\". Wallace walked out of the courtroom a free man.</p><p>The press, of course, delighted in the whole thing. Lurid headlines surrounded the case from beginning to end. Wallace was painted as an occultist, a philander and most of all an intellectual, chess playing mastermind - \"The chess player they couldn't checkmate\", as one newspaper put it. </p><p>Straight from the pages of fiction, Wallace had impeccably plotted a fiendish murder that both outwitted the police and generations of armchair mystery solvers. But if Wallace really was a criminal genius, he did not have long to savour his victory.</p><blockquote><span>\"The Wallace murder had no key-move and ended, in fact, in stalemate\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Seemingly diminished by the ordeal of his wife's death, the trial and the accusations in the press, Wallace moved away to a quiet bungalow in the Wirral.

Julia Wallace's handbag, a classic honeypot for any genuine burglar, was resting on the kitchen table next to where Wallace says the insurance money was taken. The handbag contained money and silver, yet the burglar ignored it. </p><p>The fact there was no sign of a break-in and the murderer calmly left and locked the doors behind him all but rules out an opportunistic burglar like the Anfield Housebreaker. And no such robber would have had a key or have been allowed entry by Julia Wallace, who was paranoid about strangers.</p><p>Some theorists have suggested the Qualtrough call was an attempt to lure Wallace away from the house so they could steal his insurance money, but this does not stack up as a very credible plan. Whilst it's true the chess club met in a public cafe and its schedule was pinned up on the noticeboard, nobody could have sensibly planned a robbery based on it.</p><p>The chess game schedule did show Wallace was due to play a match on the evening of the Qualtrough phone call, but it also showed that he had been scheduled to play several games in the previous month and had not turned up to them. The chess club met twice a week but by January 19th Wallace had not played since November 10th, missing numerous matches in the process. </p><p>Only one person in the world knew if Wallace would have turned up for his chess match on January 19th and thus receive the diversionary message from R. M. Qualtrough, and that was William Herbert Wallace himself. And if another culprit was somehow aware of this why did they simply not commit the crime on the 19th when they could be assured Wallace would be out all evening?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/liverpool-chess-club-notice.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The chess club's schedule showing Wallace's matches was visible on the cafe's noticeboard</div></figcaption></figure><p>If not robbery, then who else would have had motive to murder Julia than her husband? By 1931, Wallace's wife was an elderly woman, who lead quite a sheltered life and had few family or friends. Nobody has ever managed to come up with anybody who would have had a credible motive for Julia's murder beyond her husband and age-old domestic strife behind countless other spousal killings.</p><p>That it was personal is evidenced by the degree of overkill, a classic sign of a crime of passion. A burglar would have no cause to batter Julia around the head so ferociously and for so long; eleven blows in all. It was only really Wallace who knew her well enough to have developed such an antipathy.</p><p>However, he had an alibi for the evening Julia was killed. Although to many, it seemed a bit too good to be true.</p><h3>A Conspicuous Alibi</h3><p>Central to the case against Wallace is his contrived and strange alibi for the evening of the murder. Normally not the most garrulous of men, during his hour or so sojourn to the nonexistent address in Menlove Gardens, Wallace stopped and discussed his prospective meeting with at least a dozen strangers.</p><p>Wallace says he left his house on Wolverton Street at around 6:45pm and caught the number five tram at 7:06pm. Both the conductor Thomas Charles Phillips and ticket inspector Edward Angus recalled how a visibly anxious Wallace repeatedly engaged them in conversation about exactly what route he should take in order to make his appointment at Menlove Gardens East. Both informed their passenger that they were not aware of such an address, but advised him which tram he should take next.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/anfield-tram2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Wallace was acting conspicuously on the tram</div></figcaption></figure><p>As an insurance salesman and collections agent, it was Wallace's job to travel around Liverpool and he knew the city well. He would often make hundreds of collections in a given week, either by foot or by travelling on the tram and bus network. And he knew the surrounding area of Menlove Gardens quite well, his friend and occasional violin tutor Joseph Crewe lived nearby, indeed Crewe told Police that Wallace had visited his home on many occasions. </p><p>In light of what Crewe told police, it did not make much sense that Wallace would need to repeatedly pester the conductor about which route to take. Was his conspicuous questioning on the tram actually Wallace's attempts to establish a timed alibi for his whereabouts during the murder? According to Thomas Phillips, Wallace did not even take his advice anyway, seemingly knowing exactly where he was going.</p><p>On alighting the tram Wallace talked to at least four local residents, a woman he stopped in the street, a man at a tram shelter, a young man named Sydney Hubert Green and Katie Ellen Mather who lived at 25 Menlove Gardens West. None of them had heard of Menlove Gardens East, and North and South didn't even have a 25.</p><p>Wallace claimed in later statements that it was now it had dawned on him that he was on Green Lane, where his friend Joseph Crewe lived. He called at Crewe's house but he was not home, he and his wife had gone to the cinema. Was it Wallace's intention all along to stop at Crewe's house, ensure the time was noted and thus give himself an unimpeachable alibi?</p><p>But with Crewe not there, Wallace next stopped PC James Edward Serjeant, leaving the Allerton Road Station at the top of Green Lane. Despite confirming to Wallace that there was no Menlove Gardens East, the naturally reticent Wallace became strangely lugubrious, volunteering the entire tale of the Qualtrough phone call and his wild goose chase around Allerton. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/menlove-gardens-north-sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">There was a Menlove Gardens North, South and West, but not East</div></figcaption></figure><p>The most important thing Wallace discussed with Serjeant was the time - \"It's not quite eight o'clock\", he said. \"No, its quarter too\", replied Serjeant. What better alibi than a policeman? And just as had done with all those he spoke to that evening, he had fixed the time of their encounter. </p><p>He wasn't quite done. He ventured into a nearby post office and newsagents and spoke to several more people about his appointment. The newsagents even checked their account books for any Qualtroughs in the area but to no avail. Wallace says at this point he gave up and elected to return home.</p><p>There, we have the curious business with the door locks. His neighbours the Johnstons were alerted to Wallace's predicament by the sound of him knocking on the back door to no answer. \"I have tried both the back and the front doors, and they are both locked against me\", he told them. But with the Johnstons watching on, the backdoor to the kitchen then unlocked with little effort.</p><p>Some believe this to be a theatrical performance on the part of Wallace, designed to ensure he would have his next door neighbours the Johnstons as witnesses as he entered the house and discovered Julia's body. </p><p>It's certainly hard to reconcile with his innocence, even if his struggle to open the doors could be explained by old and rusty locks, as the defense maintained at the trial, it does not explain either why he appeared to be so confounded by locks he used dozens of times a day or how the true assailant had entered the property without any sign of force and then locked the doors when they left.</p><p>As for the mysterious Qualtrough, police searched Liverpool and found five people of that name, but all denied making the call. Naturally since the call was almost certainly part of a criminal plot, nobody would use their real name to make it.</p><p>Police believed it was Wallace himself who had made the call. He had the opportunity, the phone booth was next to the stop he had caught his tram to the chess club meet the night before Julia's murder and the timing of the call is not contradicted by his known movements. It also acted as an excellent alibi for him, ensuring he was away from the murder scene on the evening his wife was killed. </p><p>Whether he could have adopted a gruff voice sufficient to fool his acquaintance, chess club captain Samuel Beattie, is far more debatable. It would be a risky move and if Beattie was to see through the subterfuge, Wallace would have had some serious explaining to do. But as with everything in this case, certainties are hard to come by.</p><p>The acting pathologist John MacFall had now revised his time down from 8pm to 6pm, a time which helped neither side as it was long before Julia had been seen alive by numerous witnesses. With the uncertainty about the time of her death, this gave Wallace a very slim but not impossible chance to have killed Julia either before or after his journey to Menlove Gardens.</p><p>However, he would have had to tidy himself up and change his clothes afterwards, due to the amount of blood splatter caused by the ferocious attack on Julia. It seems very improbable Wallace could have had the time to do this, however you move the puzzle pieces. Could he have had an accomplice?</p><h3>The Accomplice</h3><p>Some students of the Wallace case believe he did not commit the killing himself but hired somebody else to do it for him. If correct, this would make many of the objections to Wallace's guilt based on the timings of the murder go away. And there is some evidence that points in this direction.</p><p>In Wallace's police statements, he states that he returned straight home after giving up on his appointment with Qualtrough and did not talk to another person again. This was contradicted by twenty-year-old typist Lillian Hall who says she saw him at around 8:35pm talking to another man on Richmond Road, close to Wolverton Street. Hall had known the distinctively tall and angular looking Wallace by sight for years; she was friends with his next door neighbour's son. </p><p>Was this man an accomplice, the man who actually murdered Julia whilst Wallace was establishing his alibi? If this encounter was simply an innocent exchange with a friend or a stranger, Wallace would clearly have no reason to deny it and cast the glare of suspicion on himself.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/all-night-garage-small.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">An encounter at this all night garage may hold the key to the whole case</div></figcaption></figure><p>The accomplice theory would resolve some of the most perplexing evidence in the case. If Wallace had supplied them with a key, it would explain how the killer had managed to enter the house without force and leave by locking the doors.  And if Wallace had told him what day he would be attending the chess club, the accomplice could have posed as the mystery Mr. Qualtrough and placed the call to set up an alibi for him.</p><p>If Wallace had somehow procured the services of a professional hitman, we will probably never know his identity. But in recent years, some investigators into the Wallace case have suggested a possible suspect in the murder named Richard Gordon Parry. Parry was a young motoring enthusiast and occasional amateur actor with a string of petty crimes to his name. </p><p>At about 1am the morning after the murder, Parry drove into Atkinson's all night garage in Allerton. Garage attendant John Parkes knew Parry from boyhood and was alarmed at how agitated he seemed.</p><p>Parry told Parkes to wash his car down with the high powered water hose. Parkes, who had always been somewhat afraid of Parry, did what he was told. There was an unspoken sense of menace about the encounter and Parry knew he was doing something wrong, but did not say anything.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wallace-kitchen.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Wallace's kitchen were he kept his Prudential insurance money</div></figcaption></figure><p>Inside the car, Parkes found a bloody glove, prompting the watching Parry to say - \"If the police got that, they would hang me!\" He then proceeded to tell Parkes a confused story about disposing of an iron bar down a drain on Priory Road. When Parkes had finished washing the car, Parry paid him five shillings and promptly drove off.</p><p>The clearly looks extremely suspicious, but there is a problem. Parkes did not mention this incident until 1981, when he told it to author Roger Wilkes for his radio documentary \"Who Killed Julia?\" Parkes claimed he did not tell anyone at the time both because he did not want to be involved and because he was afraid Parry may retaliate. With Parry's death in 1980 Parkes says he thought it finally time to tell the truth.</p><p>Parry is particularly interesting because Wallace and his wife both knew him well. A few years before the murder, he had worked alongside Wallace at the Prudential insurance company and would frequently fill in for him during his many illnesses. Parry had been in the Wallace's house on countless occasions to pay takings from the rounds, had drunk tea with the couple and even struck up a friendship with Julia.</p><p>If Wallace really had paid someone to kill his wife, then Parry is an obvious candidate. Julia Wallace was extremely paranoid about strangers and would never let anybody in the house she did not know. Had she answered the door to Parry that night and invited him in as a friend? Or had Wallace provided Parry with a key to the house which he returned after the deed during the meeting observed by Lillian Hall?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/julia-wallace.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Julia Wallace circa 1900. Did she know her killer?</div></figcaption></figure><p>There are some problems with the theory. Parry was a Jack the lad type who spent a lot of money; he owned an expensive car, a rarity for a man his age in 1930s Britain. But there is no evidence of him coming into a large sum of money, or that Wallace had the means to pay it. </p><p>William Herbert Wallace himself also suggested Parry as a possible suspect during his police interviews, listing him as one of a handful of people Julia Wallace would have let in her house. It seems unlikely he would have done this if the pair had plotted the murder together. Police also investigated Parry at the time and concluded he had a strong enough alibi to be discounted.</p><h3>A Fatal Coincidence</h3><p>Famed crime writer P.D. James caused a stir in 2013 when she claimed to have done something that had eluded so many of her illustrious predecessors; she had solved the notoriously unsolvable Wallace case.</p><p>James's theory revolved around an audacious premise - what if the Qualtrough phone call and the murder were entirely unrelated? A fatal coincidence that has confounded and confused everyone who has studied the case for more than eighty years?</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/pd-james.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">PD James believed Wallace murdered his wife but the phone call was a coincidence</div></figcaption></figure><p>\"No rational person could possibly believe the coincidence that Wallace had decided to murder his wife on the same evening that a prankster had conveniently lured him from home and provided him with an alibi\", James set out in a Sunday Times article on the case.</p><p>James details how she believes Wallace committed the murder but that old Prudential Insurance co-worker Richard Gordon Parry made the call as a malicious prank. Parry had a reputation for dipping his fingers into the till, and it was thought he had syphoned off some of the collections money during his time working alongside Wallace at the Prudential.</p><p>Wallace may have informed his superiors about Parry's stealing, leading him to be quietly dismissed from the firm. To get back at Wallace, Parry made the call to send the ailing 52-year old on a wild goose chase around Liverpool on a cold winters night. The prank was in character for the young man, garage attendant John Parkes had previously stated how Parry was prone to calling strangers and adopting funny voices for a joke.</p><p>As the author of countless fictional murder mysteries, PD James then applies a bit of lateral thinking. If Wallace was already planning to murder his wife, could he have used the happenstance of the Qualtrough call to provide himself with an alibi? Whether genuine or not, he could exploit the call to prove he was elsewhere when the crime was committed.</p><p>James' theory is compelling to a point but falls down by relying on some of the unlikely ideas the prosecution used in the 1931 trial. In order to explain the witnesses who say they saw Julia alive and well between 6:30-6:45pm, James says Wallace may have dressed up in his wife's clothes to fool them.</p><p>Wallace was a boney, 6ft 2in tall middle-aged man with a moustache. Unless wearing a thick veil, it's hard to see how anybody could have been fooled into thinking he was a 5ft 3in, plump, elderly lady like Julia.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>A Question of Time</h3><p>At the 1931 murder trial, the defense centered their case around whether William Herbert Wallace would have had enough time to commit the crime. The police's reconstruction of his movements had firmly placed him boarding the number five tram at Smithdown Lane at 7:06pm, with both the tram's conductor and ticket collector attesting to Wallace's presence.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/wolverton-street.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Witnesses in Wolverton Street saw Julia Wallace alive at around 6:45pm</div></figcaption></figure><p>Working backwards from there, Wallace had to have left his home on Wolverton Street no later than 6:50pm. The day after the murder, a sixteen-year-old milk delivery boy came forward to say he delivered milk to number 29 Wolverton Street that evening, around 6:45pm, and even briefly talked to Julia Wallace about their respective colds.</p><p>Close's story was seemingly confirmed by paperboy James Wildman, who glanced up at the clock on the nearby Holy Trinity Church as he made his way to Wolverton Street on his usual rounds. It was just after 6:35pm. A couple of minutes later, whilst delivering a paper to number 27, Wildman saw Alan Close at the Wallace house.</p><p>The two separate witness statements tally together, and one of them is backed up by the timing of a nearby church clock. Even the most generous of readings based on these witnesses gave Wallace only about 10 minutes to have beaten Julia to death, to have tidied himself up and change his clothes, to have hidden the murder weapon and to have locked up and left for his tram.</p><p>The police did their best to try and expand the time window Wallace had to murder his wife. They got Alan Close to reconstruct his milk round and concluded he could have reached the Wallace's house as early as 6:31pm, despite the paperboys testimony. This, they said, meant Wallace had as much as twenty minutes to act out his grim business and leave for his rendezvous with Qualtrough.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/holy-trinity-church.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The last sighting of Julia Wallace was fixed by this church clock (credit: Rept0n1x)</div></figcaption></figure><p>This tendentious argument may have been enough to convince a jury already predisposed against Wallace to send him to the gallows. But the cooler heads of the appeal court quickly overturned their verdict and Wallace walked free. </p><p>Despite dozens of books and endless debate, the simple fact that William Herbert Wallace did not seem to have enough time to kill his wife remains the strongest reason to believe he did not.</p><h3>Parry</h3><p>Noted crime writer Edgar Lustgarten said of the Wallace case - \"Any set of circumstances that is extracted from it will readily support two incompatible hypotheses; they will be equally consistent with innocence and guilt. It is pre-eminently the case where everything is cancelled out by something else.\"</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/richard-parry-1934-arrest.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Richard Gordon Parry's arrest photos for an unrelated crime in 1934</div></figcaption></figure><p>Lustgarten astutely sums up the case against Richard Gordon Parry. All of the arguments used against Parry by those who believe Wallace was involved equally apply if Parry acted alone or with his own accomplice.</p><p>Parry's name had been alluded to by numerous writers on the case since 1931, and even William Herbert Wallace himself mentioned him as a possible suspect in his police interviews. Author Jonathan Goodman built his classic 1969 book The Killing of Julia Wallace around Parry, who he named only as \"Mr. X\" for legal reasons.</p><p>In 1981, a year after Parry died, Roger Wilkes' radio documentary was the first to publicly name him as the possible real culprit in the murder of Julia Wallace, based on the testimony of garage attendant John Parkes who says Parry all but confessed to him on the night of the murder.</p><p>The evidence can be stacked up against Parry quite convincingly. He was a flash young man who had an expensive car and a lifestyle beyond his means. He had worked with Wallace a few years earlier at the prudential and knew the Wallaces and their home well. Crucially, he was also aware that Wallace kept often large sums of insurance collection money in the house. </p><p>It was when Parry was filling in for his insurance rounds that William Herbert Wallace first noticed money was missing from his ledger. Parry had been dipping into the takings and would do so on other occasions during the next year. Although not sacked as some authors have alleged, Wallace did inform his superintendent Joseph Crewe about the thefts and this probably lead to a mutual agreement with Parry and his father for him to discreetly leave the firm in late 1929.</p><p>Most authors who promote the Parry theory believe the young man, perpetually short of money and with a string of petty criminal offenses to his name, decided to rob Wallace for his Prudential insurance takings. Some authors promote a variation on this theory where Parry himself had an accomplice, another former Prudential employee called Richard Marsden.</p><p>Parry frequented the Cottle cafe, where he was an occasional player in an amateur dramatics group that rehearsed there. The Cottle cafe was also where Wallace's chess club met, and where the chess match schedule showing he was due to play on the 19th of January was pinned to the notice board for all to see.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/chess-schedule.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Parry may have seen the chess schedule at the Cottle cafe</div></figcaption></figure><p>According to John Parkes, Parry had a facility with affecting voices, and would often make prank calls to people. If Wallace himself had not posed as R.M. Qualtrough and made the hoax call to the chess club, then clearly Parry looks like a prime candidate.</p><p>Most Parry advocates theorize he made the phone call to lure Wallace away from his house. Using his car he could have parked on a street and surveilled Wallace, waiting for him to leave his house so either he or an accomplice could call round to commit the burglary.</p><p>Exactly how they gained entrance, and exactly what transpired inside to leave Julia's battered body laying dead in the front parlour, is unknown. Both Parry and proposed accomplice Marsden were known to Julia, so it's possible she let them in voluntarily, one distracting her as the other rifled through the kitchen for the insurance money. Perhaps Julia realised what had happened and tried to raise the alarm, resulting in her inadvertent killing.</p><p>Whatever actually occurred, John Parkes says early the next morning Parry stopped off at his garage and asked him to wash down his car inside and out. Inside was a glove covered in blood. Parry remarked darkly that he would hang if the police found it. Parry mentioned disposing of an iron bar, which the Wallace's maid later reported was missing from the parlour.</p><p>If John Parkes' story is true then it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Richard Gordon Parry was directly involved in the murder of Julia Wallace. The exact nature of his involvement or whether it included anybody else is, like most of this baffling case, likely to remain a mystery.</p><h3>The Johnstons</h3><p>Most writers on the Wallace case agree that Julia Wallace's killer must  either have known her or had a key for 29 Wolverton Street. Two people who fit both criteria are the Wallace's neighbours John and Florence Johnston. The couple were present in the backyard as Wallace struggled to gain entry to his house just before he discovered Julia's body.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder/johnstons.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">John and Florence Johnston in the 1940s</div></figcaption></figure><p>As was common practice in the 1930s, the Johnstons had a key for their neighbour's house. They would also have been well placed to observe if the Wallaces were at home or not. In a 2001 newspaper article, authors Tom Slemen and Keith Andrews allege that John Johnston was the real murderer of Julia Wallace.</p><p>Slemen and Andrews say they tracked down a man who befriended an elderly John Johnston when he was living in an old people's home in the 1960s. Johnston confessed to this man that he killed Julia in an attempt to rob the Wallace's house. He believed Julia had left for Menlove Gardens with Wallace and killed her when she discovered him prowling around in her house.</p><p>All the usual caveats about latter-day testimony apply. Johnston was reportedly suffering from senile dementia at the time and may not have fully understood what he was saying. The Johnstons were also never regarded as suspects by the police. They did, however, move out of the area the very next day after the murder, which raised some eyebrows.</p><p>The Wallace case is like a jigsaw puzzle where the last piece never fits. No matter how many times we reassemble it, it stubbornly refuses to form a complete image. At the centre of that fragmented picture remains the unknowable figure of William Herbert Wallace; flustered insurance salesman or criminal genius?</p><p>It's fitting we leave the last, typically ambiguous words, to Wallace himself. Sydney Scholefield Allen, a junior defense counsel at the trial who went on to become a long-serving British MP, was called to Wallace's side as he lay dying of kidney disease in 1933. \"Well we won sonny, didn’t we\", he told Allen.</p>","tile":"the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder","path":"the-killing-of-julia-wallace-an-impossible-murder","date":"2018-02-26T20:01:37.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 26, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"The Killing of Julia Wallace","subheadline":"An Impossible <span>Murder</span>","snippet":"Did William Herbert Wallace stage an elaborate locked-room mystery to murder his wife Julia?","tags":["murder","mystery","unsolved","impossible","wallace","william herbert wallace","julia wallace","raymond","chandler","pd james","alibi","liverpool"],"title":"The Killing of Julia Wallace - An Impossible Murder","tileheadline":"An Impossible Murder"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/gold-bullion.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Yamashita treasure consisted of billions of dollars worth of gold bullion</div></figcaption></figure><p>In the closing months of WW2, as American troops closed in, General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Japanese Imperial Army committed the latest in a string of terrible war crimes.</p><p>It was in a huge tunnel complex dug by the Japanese at the Cagayan Valley in the Philippines.

The men inside, if they did not commit suicide, were left to suffocate to death taunted by the vast riches surrounding them.</p><p>The slave laborers suffered the same fate. Takeda and Yamashita did not enjoy their grim work, but they had no alternative — it was the only way to be certain the location of the treasure houses would not get out.</p><p>Prince Takeda fled back to Japan by submarine. Yamashita took what was left of his army to the north of the country where he held on against overwhelming American opposition before surrendering on September the 2nd.</p><p>If this story wasn’t already amazing enough, what would happen next would have a profound effect on the history of the world. It also remained completely and utterly secret. A secret still hidden even today.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/general-tomoyuki-yamashita-golden-lily.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Yamashita surrenders to the American forces</div></figcaption></figure><p>American intelligence had already learned of the incredible Japanese plunder before the end of the war. Undercover operatives had tracked boats disguised as hospital ships to the Philippines and watched as the treasure was unloaded.</p><p>For the Americans, the loot was fair game. Asian gold was largely unaccounted for in international finance, and the possibility of it falling under communist control had to be avoided at all cost.</p><p>The idea of using war loot to fund black operations had previously been discussed by senior figures in the American government in 1944. Such riches could be used as a vast secret slush fund to help in the post-war fight against communism.</p><p>But Yamashita was swiftly tried for war crimes, some thought unjustly and with undue haste. With the general appearing daily in front of international observers and news cameras, they were unable to torture him for information about the burial sites.</p><p>Instead, they turned to his staff. A young Captain seconded from the OSS, Edward Lansdale, and an American-Filipino torture specialist, Santa Romana, turned their attention to Yamashita’s personal driver.</p><p>It wasn’t long before he broke and agreed to lead the Americans to 12 of the vaults he had driven Yamashita to in the north of Manilla. What Landsdale and Santa found inside was staggering.</p><p>Row after row of gold bars, piled head high. Tons of platinum. Ceramic jars full of jewels and diamonds. Magnificent solid gold buddhas. Priceless artwork. This one vault alone was worth billions in 1945 dollars.</p><p>The men were stunned by their find. They immediately reported back to General MacArthur and then traveled to Washington to brief President Truman.</p><p>It was here that a pivotal decision was made — the loot had to remain secret. Repatriating such vast treasures would be a logistical minefield, especially with many of the countries it was stolen from under communist control.</p><p>Furthermore, revealing the existence of such huge sums of precious metals would cause the gold price to plummet, and currencies around the world pegged to gold to crash. Truman feared an economic bloodbath.</p><p>But most of all, the huge sums generated by the Golden Lily treasure could afford the US incredible power in the cold war. Such an immense, covert slush fund could manipulate governments around the world, buy elections and bankroll near limitless black operations.</p><p>For the next 2 years, the Americans worked to recover hundreds of billions of dollars worth of treasure from the tunnels in the Philippines, after which it was deposited under utmost secrecy at over 170 banks across the world.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/gold-bars-vault.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Americans discovered treasure vaults with gold stacked high to the ceiling</div></figcaption></figure><p>These Golden Lily funds would have many guises over the next 50 years — the M-fund, the Yotsuya fund and the Black Eagle Trust.

The Japanese assault on the then Chinese capital was notorious for the widespread gang rape, murder, and arson.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/japanese-pow-war-crimes.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Japanese committed brutal war crimes against civilians and POWs</div></figcaption></figure><p>The cruelty inflicted on the population were barely conceivable. 2 Japanese soldiers had a contest to be the first to behead 100 people. Pregnant women were bayoneted in the stomach. The horror was off the scale.</p><p>Their looting at Nanking was also colossal. Museums, temples, government buildings and shops were stripped bare. Japanese soldiers left behind the ruins of a city littered with corpses, pulling cartloads of treasures.</p><p>This picture of systematic looting by Japanese troops was observed throughout the war and featured heavily in allied reports in the aftermath.</p><p>The great mystery here is where this plundered wealth went. For when the Americans moved in and took control of the rebuilding of Japan after the war, they told the world that the country was broke.</p><p>The contrasts between post-war Japan and Germany are telling. The Allies launched an aggressive campaign of denazification in Germany and declassified all the records detailing Nazi war crimes.</p><p>In the post-war era, successive German governments have recognized their responsibility to amend for their crimes and have paid out around $45 billion in reparations to the victims. These payouts continue to this day.</p><p>In Japan, the story was quite different. Since the end of the war, only $3 billion has been paid out to victims of Japanese atrocities. This is massively dwarfed by the figure the country has paid out to those responsible for the crimes in compensation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/japanese-surrender-1945.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Japanese surrender to US forces</div></figcaption></figure><p>In American occupied post-war Japan, only a handful of the worst war criminals were executed.

The Japanese royal family, thought by many to be sponsors of the looting, were portrayed as innocent victims.</p><p>Nobusuke Kishi, once charged with war-crimes, would even go on to become the Prime Minister of Japan in the 1950s.</p><p>The Americans also did their best to allow Japan to dodge reparation claims. John Foster Dulles forced through a clause in a 1951 treaty that exempted Japan and its corporations from paying compensation to the victims of their wartime crimes, apparently because Japan was broke.</p><p>This astonishing clause is still cited in the American senate today to deny victims long sought after justice. It flies in the face of the massive economic boom Japan went through in the post-war period, becoming one of the largest economies in the world.</p><p>It also left a hole in history. The enormous wealth everyone knows the Japanese looted from Asia during the war had vanished without a trace. The Americans didn’t have it. Japan was bankrupt.

In 1971, one man finally hit the jackpot.</p><p>Rogelio Roxas, a Filipino locksmith, had been given a map by a Japanese soldier in the 1960s. After years of digging he and his small band of men found a tunnel complex hidden behind a hospital in the mountain resort of Baguio.</p><p>The tunnels were elaborate and the men feared booby traps. After days of painstaking excavation, they found a passageway full of the skeletons of Japanese soldiers.</p><p>These, it seems, were the unfortunate men entombed by Yamashita and Prince Takeda when they sealed the vaults in 1945.</p><p>Investigating further, the crew found spectacular treasure. A 1-ton solid gold Buddha and crate after crate of gold bars. More gold than the men could possibly handle.</p><p>They hit upon a plan. They would take and sell the Buddha and use the money to hire trucks and equipment to extract the rest of the treasure. This, sadly, would prove to be a terrible mistake.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/roxas-golden-buddha.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Roxas claimed to have found an incredible solid gold Buddha (credit: Takeaway)</div></figcaption></figure><p>News of Roxas’ discovery had reached the Philippines’ avaricious dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He sent his soldiers to Roxas’ house to ransack the place and steal the Buddha.</p><p>Roxas foolishly went to the press and local prosecutors to complain about the theft. Opposition leaders sensed a chance to embarrass Marcos and seized upon Roxas’ allegations.</p><p>An inquiry into the golden Buddha affair was called by the senate, where much evidence about the theft and Marcos’ corruption was presented to the court. The president was furious and vowed revenge.</p><p>The senators weren’t aware that the extraordinary row over the theft of the Buddha would ultimately lead to the end of democracy in the Philippines altogether.</p><p>The next year, at an opposition rally protesting Marcos’ rule, grenades were thrown into the crowd, killing 10 people. Although it was evident Marcos himself was responsible, he blamed communists and declared martial law.</p><p>Habeas corpus was suspended and Marcos had his opponents rounded up and jailed. Democracy in the Philippines had died and Marcos had tightened his ruthless grip on the country.</p><p>All the while, the president would have his soldiers repeatedly capture and torture Roxas and his men to try and locate the entrance to the tunnels.</p><p>The prolonged torture had turned Roxas into a physical wreck. Somehow though, he resisted and did not talk. But one of his digging team did. After having his teeth pulled one by one without anesthetic, Roxas’ friend Olimpio Magbanua relented.</p><p>Marcos had discovered the treasure vault’s location, and over the next year his troops would extract an estimated 10,000 gold bars from the tunnels, worth tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>The story has a strange footnote. In 1996, after the deaths of both Marcos and Roxas, a US court in Hawaii awarded Roxas’ heirs a judgment of a staggering $43 billion dollars against the Marcos estate.</p><p>To date, not a cent of it has been paid.</p><h3>King Midas</h3><p>Ferdinand Marcos was the Philippines president from 1965 until his overthrow in a popular uprising in 1986. Marcos was a cruel and brutal ruler who, allegedly, got rich by stealing from his own people.</p><p>By the time he was ousted in 1986, his wealth was officially estimated to be $10 billion. However, some think this figure is only a fraction of the true amount.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/president-ferdinand-marcos-imelda-marcos.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda were obsessed with gold</div></figcaption></figure><p>Marcos himself privately boasted of much higher sums, perhaps as much as $1 trillion. And the source, he always claimed, was Yamashita’s gold.</p><p>Back in 1974, Marcos was already a rich man when he emptied the Golden Lily vault discovered by Roxas. But what he found inside made him fabulously wealthy.</p><p>Even this, though, was not enough for the pathologically greedy despot. He knew there were more vaults yet to be found in the Philippines and was determined to find them.</p><p>But Marcos had a problem, the gold only made him theoretically rich. He couldn’t sell plundered WW2 gold without its origins becoming obvioUS To realize the wealth, he had to make it look like it was mined in the Philippines.</p><p>In 1975, Marcos turned to an American mining engineer named Robert Curtis. Curtis was an expert in changing the metallurgical fingerprints of gold to disguise its origins.</p><p>Marcos courted Curtis with talk of incredible stashes of WW2 loot hidden on the island. He told Curtis he had acquired Japanese maps entrusted to a Filipino man by none other than Prince Takeda himself, the architect of Golden Lily.</p><p>Curtis couldn’t resist the prospect of unearthing such huge treasures and agreed to help Marcos follow the maps and find more Golden Lily vaults.</p><p>Together they found 5 more of the tunnel complexes, piled high with dizzying amounts of gold and jewels. Marcos, however, was not about to share the treasure.</p><p>One day, he had his men escort Curtis to the American military cemetery at Ft. Bonifacio. Curtis was shocked to see one of the graves was freshly dug. He realized, as the gun was placed against his head, that it was meant for him.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/robert-curtis-meets-marcos.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robert Curtis meets Marcos in 1975</div></figcaption></figure><p>The American managed, somehow, to talk his way out of a bullet in the head. He told the men he had the maps to the other vaults and Marcos would never find them if they killed him. The bluff bought his life.</p><p>Having narrowly escaped death, Curtis immediately fled the Philippines and returned to the US But the American did claim one small victory in the sorry affair — he had photographed the treasure maps and could perhaps return one day to resume the search.</p><p>Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in 1989. It wasn’t until 1992 that his widow Imelda first publicly commented on the source of her husband’s vast wealth. It was, she admitted, because of Yamashita’s gold.</p><p>According to Imelda, her husband had become so rich from the looted gold that it would have been ‘embarrassing’ to admit it. She estimated their true fortune to be close to 1 trillion dollars.</p><p>Such claims sound fanciful. But if Marcos really had found some of the Golden Lily treasure vaults, they might well just be true.</p><h3>Black budgets</h3><p>If the United States had claimed some of the Golden Lily treasures after the war, what did they spend the money on? Is there any evidence for programs that appear to have no discernible source of funding?</p><p>Recent documents put into the public domain as part of the Edward Snowden leaks place the US intelligence ‘black budget’, that is spending not paid for out of taxation or normal government revenue, at $52 billion a year.</p><p>To put that into perspective, the entire NASA budget in 2014 was $18 billion dollars. It is larger than the entire defense budgets of major countries such as Britain and France combined.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/us-military-pentagon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The US military has immense sources of black funding</div></figcaption></figure><p>On top of this, similar sums are spent by the US military on black budget top secret aircraft like the Aurora. Defense specialist Bill Sweetman estimated that there were 150 secret programs in the Pentagon that were not even known about by the White House.</p><p>Sweetman discovered many of these programs were dominated by private contractors such as Lockheed Martin, but was unable to ascertain what the source of this spending was.</p><p>Could it be the vast hoard of looted WW2 gold hidden in the Philippines by the Japanese Army? The gold allegedly funnelled by Edward Lansdale into secret caches of covert funding like the M-fund and Black Eagle Trust?</p><p>Some have speculated this unaccounted for money is generated by illegal activity such as securities fraud and narcotics. Whilst undoubtedly the US has indulged in such activity, the sheer size of the black budgets suggest some other, more esoteric source.</p><p>Perhaps that source is the legendary Golden Lily treasure.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>X doesn’t mark the spot</h3><p>For 50 years thousands of treasure hunters from all over the world have searched the Philippines. Aside from the claims of Roger Roxas, not a single one of them has found a thing.</p><p>The Americans and Marcos are only thought to have found some of the treasure vaults, and since Prince Takeda supposedly constructed 175 of them, it seems unlikely more amateurs haven’t stumbled upon one.</p><p>Critics also point out how unlikely a location the Philippines would have been for the Golden Lily Treasures. By 1943, the Island was a battleground and the Americans were in control of the seas.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/american-troops-philippines.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">American troops close in on Japanese troops in the Philippines in 1945</div></figcaption></figure><p>Bringing such huge amounts of gold to such an exposed area, with a high likelihood of it falling into American hands, would have been irrational when far safer countries such as Korea and Taiwan were available.</p><p>As for Roxas, several parts of his story are suspect. After finding one of the vaults, he says he took a solid gold Buddha to go sell to pay for trucks and equipment to retrieve the rest of the treasure.</p><p>However, the Buddha weighed almost a ton, making it cumbersome to extract from the tunnel complex. It was also an extraordinary artifact that was guaranteed to attract unwanted attention to Roxas’ find.</p><p>It would also have paid for trucks and equipment a 100 times over. Yet at the same time, Roxas says he found hundreds of small gold bars. It would have made far more sense for Roxas to hide the Buddha and discreetly sell a few of the small gold bars he found instead.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine Roxas would not have known this. Indeed, as soon as he started showing the Buddha to potential buyers the news got back to President Marcos and Roxas found himself in deep trouble.</p><h3>A circumstantial case</h3><p>The idea that the Americans, on discovering the Golden Lily treasures in 1945, secretly appropriated the loot and used it to set up a vast black budget slush fund, is an attractive one.</p><p>However, very little direct evidence exists to back it up. By the very nature of something that is supposed to be so secret, no documentation exists to properly validate the claims.</p><p>Furthermore, the amounts of gold involved, some accounts put it as much as 300,000 tons, dwarfs the total amount of gold ever known to be mined in human history, estimated to be around 150,000 tons.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-legend-of-golden-lily-yamashitas-gold/gold-bars.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">If Yashamita’s gold is real it would dwarf all the known gold ever mined.

For many in the Jewish community, the subsequent guilty verdict was seen as symbolic of the depth of anti-Semitism in the United States, on a par with the infamous Dreyfus affair in France.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/mary-phagan.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">13-year -old Mary Phagan as pictured in the press</div></figcaption></figure><p>Prominent Jewish organisations, businessmen and media tycoons rallied behind Frank's innocence and campaigned to overturn the guilty verdict. Numerous stories appeared in the press which sided with Frank and tried to cast the spotlight of blame on alternative, black, suspects.</p><p>Much of the press coverage both against and in favour of Frank was shockingly racist by today's standards, but par for the course for the American South in 1913. In a society built around discrimination, the sad murder of Mary Phagan thus became polarised between two camps of differing but equally extreme prejudices.</p><p>For those advocating Frank's innocence, he was the victim of the anti-Semitism endemic in American society; in its police and judiciary. For this camp, the true culprit was obviously the violent black man, unable to control his urge to ravage an innocent white girl. </p><p>Those who believed Frank had murdered Mary painted his supporters as part of an insidious Jewish conspiracy to help one of their own escape justice, tapping into the wider and more sinister beliefs of the time that a Jewish cabal of industrialists and bankers was taking over America.</p><p>In this feverish atmosphere, stirred relentlessly by the tabloid press, the  facts of the case got lost amongst much myth and fantasy, suborned and perjured testimony and outright lies.</p><p>To try and understand the truth in this murky case, we must go back to one Saturday afternoon in 1913, when a young factory worker went to collect her wages and was never see alive again.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/leo-frank-trial2.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Leo Frank at his trial in 1913</div></figcaption></figure><p>In early 20th century America, before child labour laws had made it illegal, it was common for girls like 13-year-old Mary Phagan to take manual work in factories. Before the safety net of social security, families like the Phagans often depended on their children working for their very survival.</p><p>Mary had worked at Atlanta's National Pencil Company factory since she was just 12-years old. Renowned in the neighbourhood for her cheerful demeanour, she was a notably pretty and popular girl who the previous Christmas had played Sleeping Beauty in the local church play. </p><p>On the afternoon of Saturday, April 26th, Mary dropped into her workplace to pick up her meagre wages for the week, hoping to then attend that day's Confederate Memorial Day parade in the town centre. She would never make it to the parade, or ever be seen alive again.</p><p>The factory's manager was Leo Frank, a 29-year-old graduate of Cornell university whose wealthy uncle owned shares in the factory's parent company.  At about noon Mary made her way to his office to collect her money, an encounter Frank recalled later when interviewed by the police. He would be the last person to admit to seeing the teenager alive.</p><p>Sometime in the early hours of the next morning, the factory's night-watchman Newt Lee made a horrific discovery. In the basement of the building he found the battered and bloodied body of a young girl, so covered in dirt it was impossible to determine whether she was black or white.</p><p>It was young Mary Phagan, beaten, raped and strangled with a cord cut deep into her neck. Despite his terror that he may be blamed, as a black man, for the murder, Lee immediately fetched the local police. Lee's worry was well founded. He was arrested and charged with the crime by police, the next day a white mob gathering outside of the station with the intent of lynching him. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/jim-conley.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jim Conley's testimony was pivotal in convicting Leo Frank</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst extra-judicial lynching had declined since its heyday in the 1890s, it was still a fairly common practice in 1913, especially against black men.

Police set about interviewing current and former workers at the factory to try and find the real culprit. Several men known to have been seen with Phagan in the past, such as a recently dismissed factory clerk John Gantt, were arrested but eventually cleared.</p><p>On Monday 1st of May detectives called around at the house of factory superintendent Leo Frank. Although not detained at this time, the officers were extremely suspicious of Frank. From the tentative timeline they had assembled of Mary Phagan's day, Frank was the last person to admit to having seen her alive. </p><p>The detectives were particularly struck by Frank's extremely nervous and agitated manner whilst talking to them. Was this strange reaction from Frank evidence of guilt or simply the reaction of a man with a noted nervous disposition not used to talking to policemen?</p><p>By now, the mood in Atlanta was one of hysteria. Thousands of people had visited the funeral home to view the dead girl's body. Demands that the murderer be found were coming from as high up as the governor and state legislature.

On the basis of this evidence, and his nervy demeanour, Frank was arrested on suspicion of the murder.</p><p>Another man, the factory's black janitor Jim Conley, was also arrested after witnesses saw him washing red stains out of a shirt in a faucet behind the factory. Whilst Conley gave numerous contradictory statements about the murder, he would later be used as the chief witness against Leo Frank at the trial.</p><p>The police now had several suspects and a lots of evidence. By far the most perplexing and confusing of this was two notes that were found near Mary's body. Ostensibly written by Mary herself, the bizarre, broken English made them virtually incomprehensible. </p><p>The first note read  \"he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef.\" The other said, \"mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me.\" </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/leo-frank-trial.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Deliberations at the trial in 1913</div></figcaption></figure><p>One thing was clear, Mary Phagan had not written these notes herself. The basement her body was found in was pitch black. It was impossible in the circumstances for a dying girl to have written the messages, and that meant only one thing. The notes had been written by her killer.</p><p>As the police developed more evidence, Leo Frank became their prime suspect. Conley was now saying that Frank had killed Phagan and he had helped him dispose of the body. Both the coroners jury and the grand jury unanimously voted to indict Frank for the murder.</p><p>The trial began on July 28th 1913, with state attorney Hugh Dorsey leading the prosecution. Dorsey attempted to portray the defendant as a sexual predator and pervert,  producing a succession of young women from the pencil factory to testify that Frank had made improper advances on them. </p><p>Dorsey's ace card was Jim Conley. By now the janitors many different stories had become one damning account of how Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan after she rejected his sexual propositions and then ordered Conley to help him dump the body in the factory basement. The two notes, Conley told the court, were written by him but dictated by Frank.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/leo-frank-jurors.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The jurors who convicted Leo Frank</div></figcaption></figure><p>Conley proved to be an unimpeachable witness for the prosecution, withstanding hours of defence cross-examination with a cool assuredness. Some observers felt Conley's testimony had been heavily rehearsed, almost as if he was reading from a script, but it was enough to convince the jury and Frank was unanimously convicted. On October 10th, judge Leonard S. Roan sentenced Leo Frank to hang. </p><p>Crowds of Atlantans who had been gathering outside of the courtroom over the last five weeks cheered the verdict. The sensational and salacious coverage of the trial in the newspapers had stoked up strong feelings against Frank in the city. As a Yankee jew, Atlantans were already predisposed against him and general resentment was also growing against wealthy industrialists and factory owners who were  believed to be exploiting child labor to run their businesses.</p><p>The rest of America was more divided by the verdict. Whilst widely celebrated in the South, Frank's conviction was questioned in the North.  Led by the New York Times, editorials appeared decrying the trial as a farce and an example of the anti-Semitism of the South. Some even suggested that Georgia was not fit for self-government.</p><p>This narrative took hold, and a campaign group of Jewish civic and business groups set out to overturn the conviction, raising $250,000 to help prove Frank's innocence. Private detectives were sent into Atlanta to review the case and numerous appeals were lodged with both the Georgian and the US Supreme Courts.</p><p>In Atlanta, Frank was still widely reviled as a child murderer and rapist, and the high-profile campaign to free him created a great deal of resentment in the area. Tom Watson, editor of the Jeffersonian tabloid newspaper, retaliated with accusations of a Northern conspiracy, headed by rich Jewish industrialists and press barons using their power to help a child murderer escape justice. </p><p>Watson's coverage flirted with ugly anti-Semitic stereotypes, but proved to be extremely popular in Georgia and served to stoke up the feeling against Frank and the Jewish community in Atlanta. It was even cited as one of the inspirations for the reformation of the KKK in the area. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/kkk.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The controversy surrounding the Leo Frank trial helped spawn the second incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan</div></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this increasingly hysterical mood was about to spill out from the newspapers and onto the streets in shocking fashion. </p><p>After all of his appeals failed, Leo Frank's supporters turned to state  Governor John Slaton. Slaton had personally reviewed the case and come to the conclusion Frank was innocent. In the face of fierce opposition, Slatton made the fateful decision to commute Leo Frank's deaths sentence to life imprisonment.</p><p>The men that came for Leo Frank as he sat on his bunk at Milledgeville prison were remarkably solemn and organised for a mob.  On the night of August 16, 1915, two dozen prominent Atlantan citizens, calling themselves the Knights of Mary Phagan, made the decision to use their Southern prerogative and dispense what they saw as the rightful verdict of the court themselves.</p><p>Armed with guns they raided the jail and drove Frank 150 miles to the site of an oak grove in Mary's hometown of Marietta, where they lynched him from a tree. The last act of the mob, none of whom were ever charged with any crime, was to return Frank's wedding ring to his wife in accordance with his last words.</p><p>The Leo Frank case had brought out the worst in everyone. Both Frank's supporters and opponents plumbed the depths in order to make their case and the wildly irresponsible newspaper coverage, with rival titles trying to one-up each other with ever more sensational stories, only served to further enrage the mood.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing feeling that Frank's case was a miscarriage of justice that spawned a shameful public murder. Whether prejudice played a part in his conviction is debatable, Frank was found unanimously guilty by three separate juries, some of whom were Jewish. </p><p>However, some of the evidence that they used to declare Frank's guilt looks decidedly suspect. The crucial role of the janitor Jim Conley has come under particular scrutiny - the bloody shirt, his lies to the police, his admission that he wrote the so-called murder notes, and his rehearsed testimony at the trial make Conley stand out as the likely real murderer for many advocates of Frank's innocence</p><p>The unsettling case of Leo Frank had largely been forgotten by the 1982, an unedifying episode that was best left to fade away into obscurity. That was until Alonzo Mann came forward with a bombshell - as the pencil factory's office boy in 1913, he had seen Jim Conley moving Mary Phagan's corpse by himself.</p><p>If true, it shredded a key part of the prosecution's evidence all those years ago. Did the testimony settle this most divisive of cases? Was Leo Frank innocent all along?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The Janitor and the Office-boy</h3><p>As he approached the end of his life, 83-year-old Alonzo Mann decided to unburden himself of a dark secret that had haunted him for nearly 70 years. As Leo Frank's 14-year-old office boy in 1913, Mann had actually witnessed a co-worker trying to dispose of the body of Mary Phagan.</p><p>Mann, who testified in the original trial that he left the pencil factory at 11:30am that day and did not witness anything, was now saying he returned at about 12:05 and saw the buildings janitor Jim Conley carrying the limp body of Mary Phagan, about to throw her down the coal scuttle next to the elevator.</p><p>According to Mann's 1982 testimony, Conley threatened to kill the boy if he told anyone what he had seen. Terrified, Mann ran home and told his parents what had happened. Keen not to get involved in something so horrific, Mann says his parents ordered him to say nothing of what he had seen to the police.</p><p>Some critics have questioned Alonzo Mann's latter day statements. Is it really credible that a white family in 1913 Atlanta would be reluctant to implicate a black man in the murder of a young white girl? It's a sound criticism, but if we take Mann's about turn at face value it is clearly exculpatory for Leo Frank.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/alonzo-mann.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The now elderly Alonzo Man in 1982</div></figcaption></figure><p>The story the prosecution told at the trial was that Conley was an accomplice after the fact, helping Frank dispose of the body in the factory's basement. Alonzo Mann says he saw Conley with Phagan's body on his own, without Frank.</p><p>Mann's 1982 story isn't the only reason to suspect Conley may have committed the murder himself. Conley was originally arrested because the pencil factory's day-watchman had seen him washing red stains out of a shirt, but it was his ever changing stories that convinced the police he had some involvement in the crime.</p><p>Conley told them he could not write, so could not be responsible for the two murder notes found near Phagan's body. Conley was quickly caught out when investigators found from co-workers that Conley could indeed write and had lied to the police. </p><p>Under extensive interrogation from detectives, the janitor then gave at least four different versions of how Frank had coerced or bribed him into helping dispose of Phagan's body and write the notes to implicate night-watchmen Newt Lee.</p><p>Whilst detectives seemed keen to believe this final version of Conley's story, it looks pretty implausible with any historical detachment. Frank was an intelligent, college educated man; a white factory owner in the racist south of 1913, would he really have hatched such a bizarre plot with a black employee, and dictated the barely literate notes found with Phagan's body?</p><p>The possibility that Conley had simply invented his story to try and deflect the blame from himself seems more believable than what he told the court during the trial. It reads like the invention of an uneducated man who had not really thought through what he was doing. </p><p>But stuck with this story, prosecutors did their best to burnish it. Conley was subjected to weeks of rehearsal, what prosecutor Hugh Dorsey called 'midnight seances'. Together with police detectives, Dorsey and his team spent hours coaching Conley, smoothing out his story to be as convincing as possible.</p><p>Conley was guided in the best way to engage jurors, to maintain eye-contact and remain composed. Conley's lawyer, William Smith, took on the role of Leo Frank's attorney, and role-played the fiercest possible cross-examination they could imagine Conley enduring, ensuring he had suitable rebuttals for anything he may be challenged on</p><p>It worked. With Leo Frank's lawyer's unable to deconstruct Conley's seemingly improbable account on the stand, his testimony did much to convict Frank in the eyes of the jury.</p><h3>The Murder Notes</h3><p>With the context of Alonzo Mann's 1982 admission, the idea that Conley actually committed the murder on his own, and wrote the notes to blame it on a fellow black man, looks a distinct possibility. </p><p>The references to a 'night witch' and 'negro' were widely believed to be an attempt to implicate the factory's night-watchmen Newt Lee for the crime. Lee was initially held by police after he discovered Mary's body but was later released and not thought to have been involved.</p><p>These so-called murder notes are the most bizarre aspect of the crime, and the mentality of their writer hard to fathom. They were certainly written by Jim Conley, investgators matched both the handwriting and the grammatical style to the janitor, rather than Leo Frank.</p><p>But if Leo Frank had dictated them to Conley as he claimed, its hard to understand what an intelligent, sophisticated man like Frank hoped the strange notes would achieve.</p><p>Both of the short messages, written in almost impenetrably broken  English, are drafted to make them appear they were penned by Mary Phagan herself. It's extremely difficult to believe a man like Frank would ever believe anybody would buy such a ludicrous notion. </p><p>Phagan's body was found in a pitch black basement, making it impossible for her to have written them. From Frank's encounters with Mary at the factory, he would also have known she was bright and articulate, hardly someone who would write such semi-literate gibberish.</p><p>A further problem with Conley's scenario regarding the notes is he testified at the trial that Frank had ordered him to burn Phagan's body in the furnace to completely remove any trace of her from the factory. Conley claims he got drunk and never carried out this part of the plan, but if this was Frank's intention then why would he need to dictate the notes at all?</p><h3>A Petty Crime</h3><p>At the trial, Mary Phagan's murder was portrayed as sexually motivated. Leo Frank, the jury was told, was a pervert and deviant with a history of sexually harassing young female employees and even boys.</p><p>The prosecution found a local landlady who said Frank had attempted to rent a room for himself and a young girl on the day of the murder. Thus, a persuasive picture was painted of a man who had murdered Phagan after he attempted to initiate a sexual liaison with her and she refused his advances.</p><p>This scenario is undermined by the meagre $1.20 wages Phagan had collected from the factory that day. When police found the girls body, the money was missing. The man who had robbed her of her life and dignity had also stolen her wages.</p><p>The motive for Leo Frank to steal Phagan's money is non-existent. $1.20 would have been a pittance for the well-paid factory boss from a wealthy family. And since Frank was accused of a sexual attack, the money was not an issue anyway.</p><p>Unlike Frank, Conley did have a motive for robbing Phagan and admitted such at the trial. Conley was a drunkard and a serial debtor and even conceded under cross-examination at the trial that he would often flee his creditors by escaping from the same basement Phagan's body was found.</p><p>Had Conley, already drunk by noon when Phagan came to collect her money, tried to rob the girl? Perhaps young Mary, fiesty and strong-willed, had put up a fight and Conley had killed her in the ensuing struggle. </p><p>Whatever the specifics, this scenario seems more credible than Leo Frank stealing such a small sum from the girl himself. A further possibility is that Frank and Conley removed the money as part of their supposed attempt to frame Newt Lee, but this is dependent on how credible you regard Conley's story about the notes.</p><h3>The Shit in the Shaft</h3><p>Jim Conley's testimony did more than anything to seal Leo Frank's fate. Yet one strange and unpleasant admission from Frank's supposed accomplice, largely overlooked at the time, appears to seriously contradict a key aspect of his story.  </p><p>Conley's startling claim was that he was in the habit of defecating in the elevator shaft, and did so earlier on the morning of Saturday the 26th, before the murder. When police first investigated the crime scene, they found the undisturbed human excrement exactly as Conley described.</p><p>The problem for the prosecution's case was that when detectives later operated the elevator, they discovered that it's crude mechanism crushed the excrement when it stopped at the basement. But Conley had told the trial that he and Frank had used this elevator to carry Phagan's corpse to the basement, something that could not have occurred without also crushing the feces.</p><p>The defence did not pursue this angle at the trial, perhaps because of its distasteful nature. It did, however, become a large part of subsequent attempts to posthumously clear Frank's name. Indeed, for some innocence advocates, the fecal matter in the elevator shaft is symbolic of the entire case against Leo Frank.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>A Guilty Mind</h3><p>In the aftermath of the murder, numerous witnesses testified that Leo Frank was behaving in an odd manner, unusually edgy and nervous to the extent that he was unable to perform simple tasks like unlocking a door or operating the factory time clock.</p><p>The first witness to report Frank's strange demeanor was the night-watchman Newt Lee. Frank called Lee to the factory at around 4pm on Saturday afternoon, after the police believe Mary was killed but before the discovery of the body. This was unusually early according to Lee's normal routine.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/leo-frank-cornell.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Detectives found Frank to be nervous and jittery around them</div></figcaption></figure><p>Lee noted that Frank appeared on edge at this meeting. Apologizing for calling in him early, Frank told Lee that he could come back in two hours. On his return at around 6pm, Frank appeared even more nervous and agitated.</p><p>The factory boss attempted to punch a slip in the time-clock but struggled with the action that Lee had seen him perform normally on several occasions previously - \"It took him twice as long this time than it did the other times I saw him fix it. He fumbled putting it in while I held the lever for him\", Lee told the trial.</p><p>An ex-employee, John Milton Gantt, visited the factory at about the same time to retrieve a pair of shoes he had left there. Gantt also noticed how jumpy and nervous Frank appeared. Was Lee's odd demeanour because he had murdered Mary Phagan earlier that afternoon?</p><p>Newt Lee also recalled how Frank had phoned him later that night whilst he was carrying out his duties as a night-watchman, but before he had found the body of Mary Phagan. This was the first time Frank had ever called him like this and appeared unusual to Lee. Was Leo Frank checking to see if the body had been discovered?</p><p>After the police first contacted Leo Frank early on the morning following the murder, several officers were suspicious of just how nervous Frank appeared. Upon calling at Leo's home at around 7:00am, both Detectives Black and Rogers were taken aback by Frank's evident distress.</p><p>Black told the trial - \"Frank's voice was hoarse and trembling and nervous and excited. He looked to me like he was pale. He seemed nervous in handling his collar; he could not get his tie tied, and talked very rapid in asking what had happened.\"</p><blockquote><span>\"Frank's voice was hoarse and trembling and nervous and excited...\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>The officers informed Frank that Mary Phagan had been murdered in the car as they escorted him to the factory. Once there, he was shaking so badly that he had trouble unlocking doors and operating the elevator.</p><p>Frank himself would later argue at the trial that he had a naturally nervous demeanour and his behaviour was not unusual considering the circumstances. Clearly this argument can be used both ways - if Frank was the murderer than his edgy behaviour is understandable, but also equally so if he was innocent and worried that the police may wrongly suspect him.</p><p>Detectives, however, had more cause to be suspicious. Not just because of Frank's manner but his statements. On the Sunday after the murder Frank told the police that he had no idea who Mary Phagan was, an obvious lie that can only be read as a dishonest attempt by Frank to distance himself from the crime.</p><p>Phagan had worked at her current job in the factory for over a year and Frank would have encountered her on hundreds of occasions. Police found over fifty pay slips signed by Leo Frank in which he'd written Phagan's name. He also admitted he spoke to the girl at noon on the day of her murder.</p><p>Most remarkably, Frank would even try to implicate John Gantt, a former factory employee, by telling police that Gantt had been intimate with Mary in the past, signalling him out as a key suspect. Since Frank claimed not to know who Phagan was, its hard to understand how he could have known this.</p><p>Police later interviewed numerous witnesses who told them they had seen Leo Frank talking to Mary on several occasions, further betraying his lie. What some of these witnesses told detective would become a key plank of the case against him at the trial.</p><h3>Wandering Hands</h3><p>An alarming number of witnesses would claim that Leo Frank had a penchant for harassing young women in his employ. Some advocates of Frank's innocence have argued that this testimony was largely tittle-tattle, suborned or exaggerated statements designed to portray Frank as a pervert capable of murdering a teenage girl who spurned his advances.</p><p>However, the sheer number of people willing to say damaging things about the factory boss seems hard to countenance in the circumstances. Much has been made by Frank supporters that anti-Semitism was the reason the town turned on him, but this argument looks somewhat overstated. </p><p>In 1913 Atalanta, as with the rest of the South, Jews were a relatively well integrated and accepted part of the community. Essentially regarded as part of the white population, anti-Semitism was rare and many Jews felt the favourable atmosphere in the South made it a refuge from the discrimination they often suffered in other parts of the country. </p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/girl-accusers-of-frank.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Two of the girls who accused Frank of making sexual advances on them</div></figcaption></figure><p>Blacks, on the other hand, were treated as third class citizens. Stripped of many civic and legal rights, segregated, vilified and often subject to brutal violence and oppression. Most of the thousands of lynchings that occurred in this period were of black men, often killed if there was even a suspicion that they had attempted to engage in relations with white women.</p><p>In this context, it does not seem very likely that so many white Atlantans would be willing to commit perjury to see a fellow white man go to the gallows instead of any of the several black suspects that were also arrested by police.</p><p>The defense did not even attempt to cross-examine any of the teenage girls that testified at the trial that Leo Frank's had made improper advances to them. 14-year-old Nellie Pettis recounted how Frank had propositioned her for sex. 16-year-old Nellie Wood would tell the court how Frank has pushed himself against her and touched her breast. Twenty girls in all gave similar testimony about Frank's impropriety.</p><p>Several male employees also described how they had witnessed Frank rubbing himself against young female workers. Whilst not proof of guilt of the murder itself, it's not hard to see how a conservative jury of the time would be predisposed against Frank in light of such testimony.</p><p>There have been competing claims that various witnessed were got at, either bribed or coerced into false testimony by both the defense and prosecution teams. With allegations flying both ways, it's hard to know what to make of the testimony of people like Nina Formby, a rooming house owner who told the trial that Frank had telephoned her premises on the day of the murder to procure a room for himself and a young girl. Did Frank hope this girl would be Mary Phagan?</p><p>Formby would eventually recant her testimony, claiming she had made it up. However, some sources suggest Formby's boarding house was actually a child brothel, so the recantation may have been an attempt to protect her reputation. It's not an entirely outlandish allegation, the rooming house was in Atlanta's red-light district and child brothels were sadly a common feature in many Southern towns at the time.</p><h3>A Problem of Time</h3><p>Some of Frank's claims about his whereabouts around the time of the murder look suspect. He would tell police that he was in his office solidly from noon that day till at least 12:35. During this time, around 12:05, he says he handed over the $1.20 to Mary Phagan and saw her leave his office and talk to a girl outside.</p><p>Much of this statement did not check out when investigators attempted to corroborate it. 14-year-old Monteen Stover says she went up to Frank's office at around 12:10 that afternoon and neither Frank or Phagan were there. Stover says she did not see or talk to Phagan at all that day and the girl Frank says he saw talking to Phagan was never found despite an extensive search.</p><p>When confronted with this evidence, Frank changed his story. Now he conceded he may have \"unconsciously\" left his office between 12:05-12:10 to visit the metal room across the hallway from his office. This admission looked bad for Frank, as investigators had found blond hair  twisted around a lathe handle in the room and blood splatter on the floor, leading them to believe this was where Phagan had actually been killed.</p><p>The metal room also housed the knurling department, where Mary Phagan worked fitting the metal bands around the rubbers on the end of the pencils. This led prosecutors to speculate that Frank had used some pretense to lure Phagan to the room in order to make a sexual advance on her.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank/prosecution-case.jpg?-i3\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The prosecution's case as depicted in the press</div></figcaption></figure><p>Some forty men, across three separate juries, voted unanimously against Leo Frank back in 1915. All of his appeals were rejected. At the summation of the prosecution case, lawyer Hugh Dorsey gave a stirring pro-Jewish speech and rubbished accusations that anti-Semitism had played any part in his case at all.</p><p>Dorsey had a reputation as a moderate liberal and was not prone to demagoguery.  Noted historian Albert Lindemann has written extensively on Jewish history and anti-Semitism and believes the jury convicted based on the quality of Dorsey's arguments.</p><p>\"The case that Dorsey built against Frank was not based in any overt way upon anti-Semitism. Five Jews sat on the grand jury that indicted Frank. It seems safe to conclude that they were persuaded by the concrete evidence that Dorsey presented, not by his pandering to anti-Jewish feeling...\", Lindemann wrote.</p><p>The case itself probably was decided by evidence, however flawed, rather than prejudice, but the poisonous war of words that surrounded the trial and its aftermath, culminating in the infamous events at the oak grove in Marietta, created a lasting legacy of resentment and paranoia which soured relations with the Jewish community in Atlanta for decades. </p><p>With overstated claims from Leo Frank's supporters and ugly anti-semitic slurs from his detractors, neither side comes out of this tragic affair well. </p><p>As for what really happened that Saturday afternoon in 1913, only two men know for sure. They are Leo Frank and Jim Conley. Credible cases can be made for both men's guilt, whereas equally viable arguments exist for their innocence.</p><p>Frank was eventually pardoned in 1986 by the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, who did not exonerate Frank but acknowledged their failure to protect him from his lynching. </p><p>That brutal event ended any chance that Frank would ever get justice on Earth, but The Ballad of Mary Phagan, a then popular folk song inspired by the case, supposed that Frank's ultimate judgement may be faced somewhere else.</p><p>@block-ads</p>","tile":"the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank","path":"the-murder-of-mary-phagan-lynching-leo-frank","date":"2018-02-23T19:18:55.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 23, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"The Murder of Mary Phagan","subheadline":"Lynching <span>Leo Frank</span>","snippet":"Was Leo Frank, imprisoned and lynched for the murder of Mary Phagan, wrongly convicted?","tags":["murder","conviction","unsolved","racism","antisemitism","mystery","1913","usa","america","georgia"],"title":"The Murder of Mary Phagan - Lynching Leo Frank","tileheadline":"Lynching Leo Frank"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/welcome-to-jonestown-sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jim Jones' compound in Guyana</div></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone was welcome at the People’s Temple.

Dark suspicions that the events of Jonestown were some kind of CIA mind control experiment began to circulate.</p><p>Questions also surrounded the Reverend Jim Jones himself. Who exactly was the mysterious preacher and how had he led nearly a thousand ordinary American people to their deaths in the jungles of South America?</p><p>Born during the Great Depression in 1931, Jones’ grew up in a broken and troubled home. His father was a Ku Klux Klansman, something that would have a deep and abiding effect on Jones’ politics for the rest of his life.</p><p>Neglected by his parents, the young Jim Jones was taken under the wing of the local pentecostal ministry and would be greatly influenced by the fire and brimstone preachers he witnessed giving sermons at the church.</p><p>Inspired by their example, Jones would develop his own brand of grandiloquent oratory. But with this came a sadistic tendency to use his skills to manipulate and bully others, a key factor in the tragedy that would unfold many years later at Jonestown.</p><p>Long repelled by his father’s racism, Jones gravitated towards black audiences, finding them particularly receptive to sermons in which Jones would advocate racial equality and rail against the injustices of capitalism.</p><p>That highlighted the strange dichotomy of the Reverend Jim Jones — he was an atheist. In fact, he was actively hostile to religion and would tear up and decry the bible at his sermons. For Jones, the ecclesiastical trappings were simply a vehicle for his political and social campaigning.</p><p>The absurdity of a man who hated religion forming his own church is perhaps somewhat lost to history, yet that’s exactly what Jones did in 1956. But then the People’s Temple wasn’t really a church at all, it was a cult, with Jim Jones as its god.</p><p>Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the People’s Temple would spawn dozens of branches around California with thousands of followers and a largely black congregation. As this was the height of the civil rights movement in America, Jones’ church and influence amongst black voters lent him the political power he always craved.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/reverend-jim-jones.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Reverend Jim Jones in the 1970s (credit: Nancy Wong)</div></figcaption></figure><p>But it seems, it wasn’t just politicians who took an interest in the People’s Temple. In the 1960s, the CIA opened a secret file on Jim Jones. The agency has always refused to explain what their interest was in Jones, and they would later inexplicably claim the file was empty.</p><p>It was clear the interest was far from routine with the news that the CIA’s internal Office of Security had also vetted Jones, something that would normally be done for those selected to work for the agency. Was Jones a CIA agent?</p><p>Extra weight was given to the possibility by the revelation that Jones’ childhood friend and long-time associate, former police chief Dan Mitrione, worked throughout the 1960s for a secret CIA front organisation who specialised in torture and assassination.</p><p>By the 1970s, the People’s Temple was flourishing, but the controversies over Jones’ Church also grew. Allegations of sexual abuse, torture and brainwashing caused a major scandal that made national headlines and even drew the attention of congress.</p><p>In reaction, the increasingly paranoid Jones dismissed the attacks as an orchestrated campaign against him. Taking the most extreme action, in 1977 he relocated his entire ministry to a settlement in Guyana, South America, he christened Jonestown.</p><p>Ostensibly an agricultural commune, Jonestown was more like a prison camp, with armed guards patrolling its perimeter. Although now far away from media scrutiny in America, the stories of braining washing and torture persisted. Those who managed to escape Jonestown even reported many of its members were been held against their will.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/congressman-leo-ryan.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Congressman Leo Ryan led an inspection of Jonestown, but paid for it with his life</div></figcaption></figure><p>The American government had to act. Accompanied by an NBC camera crew and reporters, US Congressman Leo Ryan led a party to Guyana to inspect conditions at Jonestown. 4 Members of the group would not leave Guyana alive.</p><p>Although superficially cordial, Ryan’s visit was tense. Whilst an increasingly rambling and incoherent Jim Jones dismissed any suggestions of impropriety, several members of the commune slipped Ryan notes begging him to help them escape.</p><p>Seemingly realising Jonestown was doomed, Jones apparently ordered a team of gunmen to follow the congressional party to at the airstrip. On November 18th, 1978, Ryan, 2 NBC reporters and a cameraman were shot dead as they were preparing to board their plane.</p><p>Shortly after, Jones enacted the very last of his ‘White Nights’. This was how the preacher described the suicide drills he would regularly conduct at Jonestown. He had already prepared his congregation for the possibility of what he called ‘revolutionary suicide’, as a protest against the injustices of the world.</p><p>Claiming that troops would soon arrive and take their children, Jones told his flock that suicide was the only way out. Remarkably, most of them accepted what the leader had ordered. Within a couple of hours, almost everyone was dead, including Jones. Only a handful who hid or feigned death to avoid drinking the cyanide laced kool-aid made it out alive.</p><p>But could over 900 people really have agreed to commit suicide at once? The Guyanese pathologist Dr. Leslie Mootoo was the first to examine the bodies. Shockingly, he concluded most of the residents had actually been murdered.</p><p>There was also an inexplicable discrepancy in the body count. The Guyanese had found 408 bodies, but later, when the Americans arrived, this was revised to a mind-boggling 913, along with some unconvincing explanations for the disparity.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/us-army-evacuates-jonestown-bodies.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">US troops evacuate the bodies (credit: Jonestown institute)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Along with these problems, there were troubling details about Jonestown itself. Vast quantities of antipsychotic drugs were found at the site, far in excess of what would normally be needed for 900 people. The camp also hosted a sophisticated hospital, and Jonestown residents were reportedly given medical assessments on an almost daily basis.</p><p>Clearly, whatever Jonestown was, it was no ordinary agricultural commune. Was it, as some have suggested, actually a mind control operation? Were the bizarre stories of brainwashing and suicide rehearsals actually part of some sinister medical experiment?</p><p>Congressman Leo Ryan’s family certainly believed so. They filed a lawsuit 2 years later alleging that Jonestown was an extension of a clandestine CIA mind control operation called MK ULTRA.</p><p>It’s existence revealed only 3 years earlier by the Senate’s Church committee, MK ULTRA was a vast illegal operation that included experiments on unwitting human subjects, the surreptitious administration of mind altering drugs, torture and sensory deprivation.</p><p>All of these unedifying activities were also reported to have occurred at Jonestown. Had the CIA secretly continued their mind control experiments under the guise of the Peoples Temple?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>The CIA</h3><p>Jonestown had CIA connections right from the beginning. Founded in the mid-1970s, its location in Guyana was once a CIA training camp for mercenaries as part of their covert operations in Angola.</p><p>George Phillip Blakey, a pivotal figure in the forming of the Jonestown community, placed a $650,000 down-payment on the land in 1973. It was Blakey, more than anyone, who was eventually responsible for the People’s Temple relocating to Guyana, far from the scrutiny of the US Authorities.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/george-phillip-blakey-jonestown.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">CIA agent George Phillip Blakey help found Jonestown in the mid-1970s (credit: Jonestown Institute)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Blakey was also an agent of the CIA, involved with their clandestine activities in Angola. Although a member of the Jonestown community, Blakey conveniently absented himself on the day of the massacre. Blakey was also married to another Temple member called Deborah Layton, who would also play a key role in the tragedy.</p><p>Layton was one of the first Jonestown defectors to expose what was really happening at the commune, and her allegations that Jones was running a suicide cult did much to fix the idea in the public mind, leading directly to Congressman Ryan’s visit. It would be Deborah Layton’s brother Larry who would murder Ryan on the airstrip at Port Kaituma.</p><p>The pair’s father, Dr Laurence Laird Layton, was a senior scientist in the US National security establishment, who for many years worked on their top-secret chemical and biological warfare programs. Whilst not a member of the Peoples Temple, Dr Layton was an important early fundraiser for Jonestown.</p><p>George Phillip Blakey, his wife Deborah and her brother Larry all had privileged backgrounds and were born into wealthy families. That they would be involved in a backbreaking agricultural commune consisting almost entirely of poor black people is odd in itself.</p><p>But the fact all 3 of these People’s Temple members would play such pivotal roles in precipitating the Jonestown tragedy, yet survive unscathed, is deeply suspicious. Whilst it’s only speculation they were participants in some kind of CIA operation, a more solid link to the agency can be found in the figure of Richard Dwyer.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/jim-jones-richard-dwyer.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jim Jones, center, with Richard Dwyer, right.</div></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. embassy official Richard Dwyer accompanied Congressman Leo Ryan on his visit to Jonestown. Neither Ryan or anyone else in the party were aware that Dwyer was also a CIA agent or that the nearby Guyanese capital Georgetown housed a CIA station.</p><p>Dwyer’s exact role in the Jonestown massacre has long been a source of mystery. On the infamous ‘death tape’, where Jim Jones can be heard urging his followers to commit suicide, he refers to Dwyer on several occasions, asking an unknown cult member to “get Dwyer out of here before something happens to him”.</p><blockquote><span>\"Get Dwyer out of here before something happens to him\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>But according to Dwyer’s own account, he was not there. He remained at Port Kaituma in the aftermath of the shooting at the airstrip. Whether Dwyer is lying about this or not, someone at the CIA knew exactly what was unfolding at Jonestown long before the Guyanese army first found the bodies.</p><p>In the early hours of the 19th of November, before the grisly events had been discovered, the CIA’s NOIWON secure radio channel reported ‘mass suicides’ at Jonestown. Whether it was Dwyer or not, the CIA were surely present at Jonestown during or shortly after the tragedy, as there was no other way they could possibly have known anything had occurred at the commune, let alone a mass suicide.</p><p>Officially the CIA have always denied any part in the events of Jonestown, or any connection with Jim Jones, but evidently this is a lie. And what’s particularly interesting about their curious early certainty that the tragedy was a mass suicide is it is directly contradicted by the medical professional who first studied the bodies.</p><h3>The body count</h3><p>As we have seen, the CIA was keen to report the tragedy as a mass suicide before the bodies had even been discovered. The media would soon follow suit and push the mass suicide story and to this day this is still how Jonestown is most often portrayed.</p><p>Incredibly, only 7 autopsies were ever conducted out of the 913 victims and even those weren’t conclusive. All of the bodies had been left out in the heat for so long they had become heavily decomposed, destroying much of the evidence and clumsy embalming meant it was impossible to reliably determine the cause of death.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/us-army-disinfect-jonestown-bodies.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">By the time US Troops arrived at Jonestown, the bodies were heavily decomposed (credit: US Army)</div></figcaption></figure><p>The determination that the dead had died of cyanide poisoning was largely circumstantial, based on the cyanide crystals that were found in Jonestown’s medical supplies, and syringes and bottles containing the poison. No trace could be found in the vats of kool-aid though, the substance thought of have broken down in the days after the massacre.</p><p>Dr Leslie Mootoo, Guyana’s most senior pathologist, was the first medical professional to examine the bodies. Mootoo and his staff methodically examined scores of bodies and came to a surprising conclusion. According to Mootoo, most of the victims had actually been murdered.</p><p>83 of the 100 adult bodies he examined had needle puncture marks between their shoulders. As they clearly would not administer the drug themselves in this way, Mootoo concluded they had been held down and forcibly injected.</p><p>Bottles containing lethal potassium cyanide but labelled as Valium were found scattered on the ground, leading Mootoo to suspect many victims had been tricked into taking the poison, thinking they were tranquilizers.</p><p>Dozens of the bodies had also clearly been shot, and some killed with crossbows. All in all, Mootoo determined some 80–90% of the victims had been murdered. Despite this, the mass suicide story was still the one pushed by the American government and the media.</p><p>Once back in the US, many of the bodies were illegally cremated before their relatives could see the remains, whilst hundreds of others remained unidentified.</p><p>With no known eyewitnesses to the deaths and less than 1% of the bodies having been autopsied, it was essentially impossible to determine what really happened at Jonestown. Even the evidence and samples Dr Mootoo had meticulously gathered at the crime scene vanished in transit to the United States.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/jonestown-bodies.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The US Army maintained that many of the bodies were hidden underneath others (credit: US Army)</div></figcaption></figure><p>And then there was the astonishing discrepancy in the body count. The Guyanese Army counted the number of victims as 408. Days later when the US Army arrived, this number was progressively revised upwards — 775, 800, 869, 910, 912, eventually settling at the grim total of 913.</p><p>The US Army initially claimed the discrepancy was because the Guyanese could not count, an insulting suggestion that was quickly retracted. They would then say some of the bodies had fallen on top of others and covered them. But many wondered how 408 corpses could cover 505 bodies, especially when at least 80 of the initial 408 were children.</p><p>Even the 913 figure seemed odd. Estimates of the population of Jonestown were in the 1100–1200 range, not including those known to be elsewhere, meaning at least a 100 of its members had seemingly vanished without trace.</p><h3>MK ULTRA</h3><p>Like members of his family, Congressman Leo Ryan’s chief of staff Joseph Holsinger suspected CIA involvement at Jonestown. In 1980, Holsinger was made aware of a study undertaken at the University of Berkley called ‘The Penal Colony’ that gave him the darkest of suspicions.</p><p>The Berkeley paper detailed how the CIA’s mind-control program, code-named MK-ULTRA, supposedly terminated in 1973, had actually continued, moving from hospitals and government facilities to religious cults. Cults, Holsinger concluded, like Jonestown.</p><p>For Holsinger, several things about Jonestown simply did not make sense. One was the staggering quantities of pharmaceutical drugs found at the commune. For a humble agricultural community of 1200 people, most of whom worked 16 hour days for meagre food rations, the numbers defied explanation.</p><p>Amongst the drugs found at Jonestown were Quaaludes, Valium, morphine, Demerol, truth serum sodium pentothal, chloral hydrate, thallium and an incredible 11,000 doses of Thorazine, an antipsychotic. Many of the substance were noted for their mood-altering and hallucinogenic properties, exactly the kind of drugs the CIA had employed in their MK Ultra experiments.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown/thorazine-mk-ultra.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">11,000 doses of antipsychotic drug Thorazine — used by the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program, were found at Jonestown</div></figcaption></figure><p>The parallels between MK Ultra and Jonestown did not end there. The widespread accounts of the abuses at the commune — sensory deprivation, torture, punishment beatings, sexual humiliation and brain-washing, were all exactly the kind of things the CIA had been studying in MK Ultra.</p><p>Was the People’s Temple in Jonestown actually an offshoot of the CIA’s mind control projects, as the Berkeley paper suggested?</p><p>If it was, it might explain how a socialist cooperative in the middle of the Guyanese jungle acquired such vast quantities of mood altering drugs. Or how the CIA knew about the ‘mass suicide’ there before it had even been discovered.</p><p>Either way, it’s obvious that brainwashing was at work at Jonestown, even if just from the pulpit of Jim Jones himself. Whilst travelling in Brazil in the 1960s, Jones studied the mind control techniques used by voodoo cults and religions such as Santería and clearly used what he had learnt throughout his time with the People’s Temple.</p><p>Some authors have speculated he did so under the wing of the CIA. Also in Brazil at the same time, very close by to where Jones was living, was CIA torture specialist and childhood friend Dan Mitrione. Was Mitrione Jones’ case officer as many suspected? And could Jones’ trip have been a fact finding mission for MK ULTRA?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>The Death Tape</h3><p>A 44-minute audio tape, dubbed the ‘death tape’, exists which records the meeting Jones called in which he ordered the mass suicide. In it, Jones tells his congregation, as he had done many times before, that troops were going to come and destroy their community.</p><p>“One of the people on that plane is gonna shoot the pilot, I know that. I didn’t plan it but I know it’s going to happen. They’re gonna shoot that pilot and down comes the plane into the jungle and we had better not have any of our children left when its over, because they’ll parachute in here on us”, Jones is heard to say.</p><p>“So my opinion is that you be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it’s a revolutionary act”.</p><p>After a brief period of dissent early in the tape, where alternatives to suicide are suggested by some Temple members, most of those present then seem to accept Jones’ orders. Indeed the tape is quite notable for the calm and rational manner in which the community accepts their fate.</p><blockquote><span>\"…we are not committing suicide; it’s a revolutionary act\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>If any of the alternative theories about Jonestown are true, they are not recorded on this tape. However, the extant tape clearly contains numerous gaps and excisions, which suggests it was either edited ‘live’ for some reason or that events depicted that do not fit the suicide theory were edited out at a later date.</p><p>More than 30 years on, the Jonestown massacre remains one of the strangest and most disturbing events in modern history. And with not a single witness to the deaths remaining to tell the tale, we’ll probably never know what really happened.</p><p>What we do know is that hundreds of society's poorest and most disadvantaged people, mainly women and children, travelled far from home looking for salvation, only to find death of the most banal and senseless kind.</p><p><small>Cover image credit: Jonestown Institute, from Wikimedia Commons</p>","tile":"the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown","path":"the-peoples-temple-massacre-welcome-to-jonestown","date":"2019-11-03T17:18:42.556Z","formatteddate":"Nov 3, 2019","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"People’s Temple Massacre","subheadline":"Welcome to <span>Jonestown</span>","snippet":"Was the mass suicide at Jim Jones' commune in Guyana in 1978 a CIA mind control experiment?","tags":["Jonestown","Jim","Jones","Peoples","Temple","cult","CIA","MK-ULTRA","suicide","death","murder","unsolved","conspiracy","Guyana","church","mind","control"],"title":"People’s Temple Massacre - Welcome to Jonestown","tileheadline":"Welcome to Jonestown"},{"body":"<p>-et-in-arcadia-ego-painting-by-nicolas-poussin.jpg</p><p>There are two schools of thought about the mystery of Rennes-le-Château.

The village was home to an old church, dedicated to Mary Magdalene, that had fallen into disrepair after years of neglect.</p><p>The village’s priest Bérenger Saunière drew up plans to renovate the church. Whilst Saunière himself was of humble means, he managed to secure enough funding to begin the work, which commenced in 1887.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/françois-bérenger-saunière.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">François Bérenger Saunière</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was during these renovations that Saunière would make a discovery that would not only transform his own personal fortunes but launch a thousand conspiracy theories about Rennes-le-Château that endure to this day.</p><p>The exact nature of what he discovered varies between tellings, but the most popular version has it that Saunière found some parchments concealed inside a hollow pillar of the church’s altar.</p><p>Some of the parchments detailed royal genealogies dating back centuries, whilst others contained enigmatic writings which appeared to conceal some kind of hidden message.</p><p>Shortly after his discovery, Saunière would begin to act in a strange manner. He would excavate large parts of his church, and on several occasions he and his housekeeper Marie Dénarnaud would be seen digging in the cemetery at night. The municipal council even lodged an official complaint about the priest disturbing the graves.</p><p>In a diary entry around the time, Saunière makes enigmatic reference to what he had found, using but one word — ‘secret’.</p><p>Had Saunière used the parchments to find some kind of treasure? If so, it would help to explain the astonishing financial turnaround the priest enjoyed over the next few years. Suddenly the formally impoverished Saunière seemed to have access to near unlimited wealth.</p><p>Throughout the 1890s, he would spend over 650,000 francs on a lavish series of renovations and new buildings at Rennes-le-Château. For a man who only earned 900 francs a year as a priest, the sums were staggering.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/asmodeus-at-rennes-le-chateau.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Saunière had this bizarre demonic statue installed near the entrance of the church (credit: Erwan Corre/wiki)</div></figcaption></figure><p>And some of the things Saunière built with his new found riches were decidedly strange, like the bizarre neo-gothic tower that doubled as his study or the array of sinister looking statues he decorated the church with.</p><p>One such statue, of a snarling, terrifying looking devil incongruously guards the entrance of the church. Some have even speculated this statue was actually of the demon Asmodeus, associated in legend as the guardian of Solomon’s treasure.</p><p>But Saunière’s spending spree had not gone unnoticed by the Church authorities. The priest was suspended on charges of ‘mass trafficking’ a common form of 19th-century ecclesiastical fraud were priests would sell non-existent masses.</p><p>Whether Saunière was actually guilty of this or not, it could surely not account for the vast scale of his spending. Either way, the priest took the secret to his grave, dying in 1917 without ever disclosing the source of his inexplicable wealth.</p><p>More than 50 years later, what had become an obscure, long-forgotten local legend, was revived by French author Gérard de Sède in his book ‘The Accursed Treasure’ in 1967.</p><p>De Sède’s book is the basis for all modern Rennes-le-Château myth making. In it, he takes the basic outline of Saunière’s story of finding a treasure, but adds some potent and sensational new elements.</p><p>The parchments Saunière found were actually proof that the Merovingian royal bloodline had not died out with King Dagobert II, who was assassinated in 679, but lived on in secret to the present day.</p><p>Sigebert IV, Dagobert’s son who was thought to have died in infancy, in fact, survived and was spirited away to Rennes-le-Château, and both he and his descendants were buried there.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/merovingian-dynasty.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Did Saunière find evidence that the Merovingian dynasty had not died out?</div></figcaption></figure><p>De Sède also introduced the mysterious Priory De Sion, a secret order dedicated to protecting the underground Merovingian bloodline and one day bringing its descendants back to the throne of France.</p><p>‘The Accursed Treasure’ was co-written by an enigmatic figure called Pierre Plantard, who claimed to be none other than the living descendent of Dagobert II, and rightful heir to the throne of France.</p><p>De Sède’s book was a modest success but remained unknown outside of France until a British television writer discovered a copy of The Accursed Treasure in a French bookshop. What happened next catapulted the story to international fame in the most sensational manner.</p><p>Henry Lincoln, best known as a writer on the BBC’s long-running sci-fi show Doctor Who, picked up a copy of The Accursed Treasure during a holiday to Cévennes in 1969. He was immediately absorbed by this exciting tale of an impoverished priest who stumbled upon a great treasure.</p><blockquote><span>\"To Dagobert II, King, and to Sion is this treasure and he is there dead\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Lincoln poured over every detail and soon, something very obvious leapt out at him. The book contained reproductions of the parchments Saunière had supposedly found. In one of them, curiously raised letters amongst the text clearly spelt a message — ‘To Dagobert II, King, and to Sion is this treasure and he is there dead’.</p><p>Certain he had discovered something more than a mere colloquial legend, Lincoln set about on producing a TV documentary about the extraordinary story of Rennes-le-Château.</p><p>In 1972, the BBC broadcast Henry Lincoln’s landmark episode of historical history strand Timewatch called ‘The Lost Treasure of Jerusalem’.

In fact, it all seemed too good to be true.</p><p>Did a humble parish priest really discover the greatest secret of Christianity?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Saunier’s wealth</h3><p>Bérenger Saunière kept meticulous records of his official financial transactions during his time as Rennes-le-Château’s priest. The huge sums he details in his books are amazing for a man of such seemingly humble means.</p><p>His accounts show he spent 229,351 francs on land and building works, and a staggering 465,000 on consumption over a 10 year period. These figures translate to millions of francs at current values.</p><p>His purpose-built home, the Villa Bethania, cost 90,000 francs on its own, almost as much as the nearby Château de Hautefort, a lavish stately home with a beautiful Garden à la française.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/saunière-villa-bethania.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Saunière built the lavish Villa Bethania with his new riches</div></figcaption></figure><p>And this was only his declared spending, Saunière was known to have paid for structures around the village which don’t appear in his accounts. The priest also never recorded any of his considerable travel and personal expenses.</p><p>Also not documented are his vast and lavish collection of valuable books, magazines, postcards and antique furniture, thought to be worth tens of thousands of francs.</p><p>The source of Saunière’s wealth is central to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, and virtually all of the many theories about the village start with Saunière. Indeed, it is a puzzling mystery, where could a humble village priest have acquired such huge wealth?</p><p>Had he discovered treasure or documents that proved Christ descendants had lived in the village? Was the source of his wealth hush money from the Catholic Church?</p><p>A more prosaic suggestion is that Saunière’s money came from simony, a then common form ecclesiastical fraud known as ‘mass trafficking’, where a priest would sell masses on a scale far beyond what he could actually perform.</p><p>Like many other priests, Saunière was certainly guilty of the practice. He was brought up in front of Church authorities because of it and suspended on several occasions. But the scale of his spending would appear to be far greater than could have credibly be accounted for by mass trafficking alone.</p><p>in the 1890s, a priest would typically charge around 1 franc for a mass, so Saunière would have had to have promised to conduct several hundreds of thousands of masses, and taken payment for them if this was indeed the source of his finances.</p><p>However, the priest kept detailed records about his mass trafficking. He had actually promised to conduct 110,000 masses and taken around 100,000 francs in payment. This then only accounts for a small fraction of the amounts he is known to have spent.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/tour-magdala-rennes-le-chateau.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sauniere’s folly the Tour Magdala (credit: Pumuckel42/wiki)</div></figcaption></figure><p>Saunière had a few other sources of income along with the mass trafficking. Gifts, donations, church collections and furniture dealing all bolstered his finances, but only account for the tiniest fraction of his prodigious expenditure.</p><p>The conclusion that Saunière did indeed find some kind of treasure seems unavoidable. But the countless theories about Rennes-le-Château vary radically what this treasure actually was.</p><p>At the most conservative end, there is some evidence to suggest that Saunière did find something at the church, perhaps later in the restorations.</p><p>One of his foster sisters, late in her life in the 1960s, recalled Saunière finding a pot full of gold coins, and other contemporary witnesses remember the discovery of a crypt under the church during the restorations. Saunière even notes the find in his diary, writing “Discovery of a tomb. What tomb?”</p><p>That a crypt, the location of which is now lost, existed under the church is well documented, seemingly a family vault of the nearby aristocratic d’Hautpoul family. Henri d’Hautpoul in his will of 1695, mentions the crypt, writing — “After my death, my body must be laid out to rest in the parish church at Rennes in the tomb of my ancestors”.</p><blockquote><span>\"After my death, my body must be laid out to rest in the parish church at Rennes in the tomb of my ancestors\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>This is particularly interesting because there are records that a treasure was associated with the d’Hautpoul family. In 1645, a shepherd found a stash of gold coins on the lands of Blaise I d’Hautpoul, which encompassed Rennes-le-Château.</p><p>Had Saunière discovered a lost crypt of a noble family, full of their riches? Or was it something more esoteric?</p><p>Whilst the story of Saunière finding 4 parchments did not emerge until the 1950s, according to Antoine Captier, the grandson of Saunière’s bellringer, some kind of document was found.</p><p>Whilst helping with the renovations, Captier’s grandfather had discovered a small glass vial hidden inside an old wood baluster. Inside was a scrap of parchment.</p><p>What was on the parchment remains a mystery, but shortly after its discovery Saunière’s nocturnal digging began, and so did his prodigious wealth.</p><h3>Holy Blood</h3><p>The 1982 book Holy Blood and the Holy Grail posited the theory that Bérenger Saunière discovered documents that proved the 6th-century Merovingian’s were actually direct descendants of the historical Jesus and his wife Mary Magdelena.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/penitent-magdalene-by-domenico-tintoretto.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Was Mary Magdelene Jesus’ wife?</div></figcaption></figure><p>For this to have occurred, evidence would be needed that Jesus had ever married in the first place, an idea rejected by most mainstream scholars due to the lack of explicit references to a wife in the gospels.</p><p>However, nothing in the extant gospels actually disavow the possibility, and lack of specific references to a wife could be accounted for by the early Christian establishment’s systematic campaign to downgrade the role of women in the Church.</p><p>Some tantalizing clues do survive. In Matthew 26:49, Jesus is described as a rabbi. Rabbis, then as now, are required to marry. If Jesus was really a rabbi and not married it would surely have been noticed and mentioned, yet no such mention exists of the discrepancy in the bible.</p><p>Mary Magdelene plays a critical role in Jesus’ life in the gospels, tending to his body after the crucifixion. But if Mary was not Jesus’ wife, it would have been considered highly inappropriate for her to perform such an intimate act as washing and anointing his naked body as depicted in the Gospel of Mark.</p><p>Several gnostic gospels also hint that Jesus had a wife and a recently recovered 6th-century Coptic papyrus has Jesus referring to Mary as “my wife” and stating “I dwell with her”.</p><p>Establishing the possibility that Jesus may have married is one thing, but evidence that he had children and that they relocated to France remains elusive at best.</p><p>That crucial aspect of the Rennes-le-Château legend depends almost entirely on the mysterious Priory de Sion, a secret order which, according to The Holy Blood, was founded in 1099 to guard the secret of Christ’s bloodline.</p><p>But what if the Priory wasn’t an ancient order at all, but a modern concoction of an imaginative French conman?</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>The Fantasist</h3><p>In terms of documented historical fact, one thing is clear about the Priory De Sion. It was not founded in 1099, but 1956. In that year, Pierre Plantard registered the societies existence with the French authories.</p><p>This is the same Pierre Plantard who later co-wrote The Accursed Treasure with Gérard de Sède, which sought to characterize the Priory De Sion as an ancient secret society dedicated to preserving the Merovingian blood line. But back in 1956, the group’s activities were somewhat more prosaic.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/pierre-plantard.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Pierre Plantard</div></figcaption></figure><p>Run from Plantard’s apartment, the Priory De Sion produced a journal called Circuit, which largely concerned itself with local matters such as affordable housing and property development. It dissolved less than a year later and continued to exist in name only.</p><p>Pierre Plantard was born in 1920, a descendent not of kings, but a 16th-century walnut gatherer. A fervent royalist and anti-semite, Plantard had grand ideas from an early age. In 1940, he offered to assist the collaborationist Vichy regime in fighting a ‘terrible Jewish and Masonic conspiracy’, claiming to have 100 men at his disposal.</p><p>The French intelligence services diagnosed Plantard as a fantasist, writing — “Plantard seemed to be one of these strange pretentious young people who set up and run more or less fictitious groups in an effort to give themselves a feeling of importance…”</p><blockquote><span>\"Plantard seemed to be one of these strange pretentious young people who set up and run more or less fictitious groups in an effort to give themselves a feeling of importance…\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>After the war, Plantard would continue to invent fanciful groups and societies, including the short-lived Priory De Sion in 1956. After this latest effort folded, he would spend the next decade inventing an entirely fictional history for his dormant organisation.</p><p>Plantard’s aim was to portray himself as a descendent of the 7th-century Merovingian King Dagobert II and, fantastically, the ‘Great Monarch’ as prophesied by Nostradamus.</p><p>In the mid-50s, Plantard learnt of the story of the Rennes-le-Château priest Berenger Saunier and the great treasure he supposedly found in the local church. Plantard liked the story and decided to integrate it into his growing mythology of the Priory De Sion.</p><p>Now, rather than a treasure, Saunière actually found parchments that supported Plantard’s claims to be a descendant of the Merovingians, including a fabricated royal lineage and hidden codes that referred to a mysterious secret order called the Priory of Sion.</p><p>Teaming up with an eccentric aristocrat and surrealist called Phillipe de Cherisey, the pair faked the parchments, along with a fabricated list of grandmasters of the priory, and deposited these ‘Dossiers Secrets’ in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/gérard-de-sède.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Plantard teamed up with author Gérard de Sède to get his story published</div></figcaption></figure><p>Plantard then teamed up with the writer Gérard de Sède and the entire fantasy was published as The Accursed Treasure in 1967. But De Sède and Plantard quickly fell out in a row over royalties, and it wasn’t long before their hoax was busted.</p><p>French investigative journalist Jean-Luc Chaumeil uncovered hundreds of letters between De Sède, Cherisey and Plantard in which they detailed each step of their deception and discussed ways they could combat criticism and keep the hoax going.</p><p>All three men would eventually admit they had made the whole thing up. But it was too late, the trio’s relatively trivial fraud had already taken on a life of its own.</p><p>Despite its status in France as an admitted hoax, three writers were about to appropriate Plantard’s self aggrandising fantasy and take it far beyond anything he had ever intended.</p><h3>The Holy Deception</h3><p>Seemingly unaware that the Dossier Secretes were a fictional invention, Henry Lincoln, Michael Leigh, and Richard Baigent used the documents to weave a vast historical conspiracy theory.</p><p>According to the authors, the order of the Priory De Sion, actually a local housing pressure group founded by Plantard in 1956, was an ancient cabal that created the Knights Templer to protect and preserve the bloodline of Christ.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-secret-of-rennes-le-chateau-lost-treasure-of-god/dossiers-secrets-d'henri-lobineau.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The authors of the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail appeared to be unaware that the Dossiers Secrets was a hoax</div></figcaption></figure><p>The trio’s research was almost entirely based on the fabrications of Plantard, but with several extraordinary leaps of logic connecting a whole series of completely unrelated new elements.</p><p>Whats interesting about the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail is it doesn’t really consist of evidence as historians would understand it. The authors dubbed their method ‘synthesis’, essentially wild speculation, and would use it add such ingredients as Leonardo Da Vinci, the Templars, the Cathars, Masons and the EU to an already heady brew.</p><p>Most of the connections the writers make in The Holy Blood are regarded by mainstream academics as pseudo-history. Although since the foundation of their hypothesis is based on the fantasies of a French con-man, the author’s claims are already seriously undermined.</p><p>It was widely commented at the time of the books release in 1982 that, whilst it made for dubious history, it was still a great story. That’s undoubtedly true, but the enduring appeal of this story is that it’s still presented as fact.</p><p>In Foucault’s Pendulum, Umberto Eco’s brilliant parody of the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he wrote — “Believe that there is a secret and you will feel an initiate. It doesn’t cost a thing. Create a truth with fuzzy edges: when someone tries to define it, you repudiate him. Why go on writing novels?

Several inventors, notably Harry Grindell Matthews in England, claimed to have invented such a weapon.</p><p>In 1907, there was much speculation in the press that the explosion that destroyed French battleship Iena in March was caused by some kind of wireless energy wave, with Tesla’s name even mentioned in connection with the disaster.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-tunguska-blast-teslas-death-ray/death-ray-sci-fi.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Death rays were a popular concept in Tesla’s time</div></figcaption></figure><p>Tesla himself gave rise to much of the speculation by repeatedly claiming his electricity transmission device could be used as a directed energy weapon.</p><p>Writing to Liberty magazine he explained — “My invention requires a large plant, but once it is established it will be possible to destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200 miles.”</p><p>Tesla wrote several letters to the New York Times in which he expanded on the potential of his invention as a death ray.</p><p>“As to projecting wave energy to any particular region of the globe…this can be done by my devices…the spot at which the desired effect is to be produced can be calculated very closely, assuming the accepted terrestrial measurements to be correct.”</p><blockquote><span>\"...once it is established it will be possible to destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200 miles\"</span><br><cite>Nikola Tesla</cite></blockquote><p>Just 2 months before Tunguska, he wrote tellingly — “This is not a dream.

Widespread reports of night turning into day flooded into the newspapers. One correspondent recounted how he was able to read a book illuminated purely by the night sky.</p><p>Tesla specifically cited the ability of Wardenclyffe to light up the atmosphere on several occasions — “I have planned many details of a plant which would be amply sufficient to illuminate the entire ocean so that such a disaster as that of the Titanic would not be repeated.”</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-tunguska-blast-teslas-death-ray/tesla-wardenclyffe-tower.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Tesla made several amazing claims about Wardenclyffe</div></figcaption></figure><p>Many of the eyewitnesses also describe earth shaking, even before the explosion.

The official theory that it was to gain political intelligence on the democratic party by bugging DNC chairman Larry O’Brien’s office’s had a serious flaw — it was not true.</p><p>Larry O’Briens phone had not been bugged.

Amongst the burglars themselves, there was a secret agenda at work. Some of them, it seems, set out to deliberately sabotage the operation, ensuring it’s discovery.</p><p>Angleton’s wilderness of mirrors was reflecting a strange and confusing picture. Was there another agenda at work? And was it designed to destroy Richard Nixon?</p><h2>Evidence for</h2><h3>The Burglars</h3><p>One critical, but often overlooked fact about the Watergate burglars is their close connections with the CIA.</p><p>The five men caught red-handed in the building were James McCord, Bernard Baker, Frank Sturgis, Eugenio Martinez and Virgilio Gonzales. McCord was a former CIA employee, whilst the latter 4 men were veterans of CIA attempts to oust Cuban leader Fidel Castro in the 1960s.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/james-mccord-eugenio-martinez-watergate-arrest-photos.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Arrest photos of James McCord and Eugenio Martinez</div></figcaption></figure><p>The burglary was coordinated by E Howard Hunt, a former White House consultant and career CIA operative who retired from the agency in 1970.</p><p>Alongside Hunt was G Gordon Liddy. The ostensible ringleader of the operation, Liddy was the only member of the Watergate 7 to have no connections to the CIA. Many, including Liddy himself in later years, regard him as an unwitting dupe to the senior CIA men in the operation — Hunt and McCord.</p><p>With so many ex-CIA men amongst the conspirators, the clear suspicion is that the Watergate burglary had been infiltrated by a CIA plot of some kind. These suspicions are deepened by a closer examination of Hunt and McCord.</p><p>Hunt’s supposed retirement from the agency in 1970 warrants skepticism. Twice before he had ‘retired’ from the CIA, only for the retirement to be revelated as a subterfuge to distance Hunt from the CIA, whilst secretly continuing to work for them on clandestine projects.</p><p>Was Hunt’s 1970 retirement another ploy to hide a continuing CIA operation? Within a year he would be at the heart of the White House, working for Nixon’s secret team of ‘plumbers’, set up to plug political leaks emanating from the government.</p><p>Whilst there, Hunt would continue to have contacts with the CIA. He would send them secret packages from the White House, supposedly filled with political gossip. He would also regularly meet senior agency directors, engagements Hunt claimed were entirely social.</p><p>Like E Howard Hunt, James W McCord had been a member of the White House’s plumbers. Also like Hunt, he was a former CIA operative, a fact which contradicts the official account that McCord was merely a lowly technician for the agency</p><p>McCord was actually a senior member of one of the CIA’s most important and secret divisions — The Office of Security. The OS was responsible for vetting employees and rooting out moles.</p><p>They were also deeply involved in covert surveillance, particularly the gathering of sexual dirt, and McCord was one of their most experienced agents. His claim to be a mere technician was the first of many lies he told about his role in Watergate.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/president-nixon-oval-office-haldeman-ehrlichman.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">President Nixon in the Oval Office with chief advisors H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman</div></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest of the lies was McCord and Hunt’s insistence that they were unacquainted with each other until introduced by G Gordon Liddy in 1972. The evidence, however, shows the two men had been professionally involved for at least a decade.</p><p>Enrique Ruiz-Williams, a veteran of the CIA’s anti-Castro operations, recalls how both Hunt and McCord were his CIA handlers in the early 1960s. Tellingly, Ruiz-Williams recalled how the pair used the same alias. During Watergate, both Hunt and McCord would again use the same alias.</p><p>In 1969, testimony from a former landlady showed that McCord and Hunt were running some kind of entrapment or surveillance operation out of a rented basement apartment, presumably for the Office of Security.</p><p>That the pair lied about their long-standing association and their roles in the CIA suggests a sinister possibility. Were Hunt and McCord actually running a covert CIA operation that night at Watergate?</p><p>Under the unwitting nose of G Gordon Liddy, were the pair operating a conspiracy within a conspiracy? A plot with a secret agenda unknown to, perhaps even against, their ostensible paymasters at the White House?</p><h3>The Bugs</h3><p>Of all the mysteries surrounding the Watergate affair, by far the most perplexing is the actual burglary itself. What was its purpose?</p><p>The ringleader of the operation was G Gordon Liddy. As far as he was concerned the purpose was to plant bugs in the office of Larry O’Brien, the leader of the Democratic National Committee, in order to gather political dirt ahead of the 1972 presidential elections.</p><p>This version of events was the one shared by the subsequent Watergate hearings, Bob Woodward’s famous Washington Post stories and the heavily fictionalized Hollywood film All The President’s Men.</p><p>As G Gordon Liddy himself now acknowledges, this official narrative is not true.</p><p>There were actually two Watergate burglaries. The first occurred on May 28th, 1972. Here, James McCord says he planted a telephone bug and a room listening device in the office of Larry O’Brien. Other accounts have an obscure DNC official called Spencer Oliver as another target.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/bugging-equipment-watergate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The bugging equipment found on the Watergate burglars at their arrest</div></figcaption></figure><p>The second burglary on June 17, where the men were caught and arrested, was supposedly ordered to correct a problem with the bug planted on May 28, and set up other bugs.</p><p>Two pieces of evidence show this official account to be a fantasy, concocted by James McCord and E Howard Hunt.</p><p>Despite the fact McCord was a surveillance expert and had access to near unlimited funds, he chose cheap off the shelf bugging equipment for the operation.</p><p>These type of wiretaps were line-of-sight. They could only operate by placing the receiving equipment in a direct line with the bug. Through windows was OK, but not walls.</p><p>To this end, McCord had rented a room in the Howard Johnson motel, directly overlooking the Watergate. But McCord knew full well that O’Brien’s office was at the opposite side of the building, meaning the bugs could never have worked.</p><p>Such an elementary error could not have been made by accident, indicating there was never any intention to bug O’Brien’s office. But as Jim Hougan revealed in his seminal book Secret Agenda, astonishingly, there was never any attempt to bug the Watergate at all.</p><p>The day before the June 17 burglary the DNC, anticipating that they may be a target for espionage, had the entire office complex swept for bugs by the phone company, who found nothing. After the June 17 arrests, the FBI also swept the building, twice, and similarly found nothing.</p><p>What was so strange about this was, for three weeks following the first break in, McCord had an employee stationed at the Howard Johnson hotel transcribing conversations from these nonexistent bugs.</p><p>Conveniently, and to the bafflement and rage of Liddy, McCord didn’t take the most basic precaution of tape-recording these wiretaps, so his deception would not be revealed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/hunt-address-book-watergate.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Hunt left incriminating evidence behind, like this address book, for police to find.</div></figcaption></figure><p>It has been suggested by some authors that the real target of the surveillance was not Watergate, but the adjacent Columbia Plaza apartments, the location of an alleged high-class call girl ring been covertly monitored by the CIA.</p><p>McCord and Hunt’s true purpose may have been to conceal this operation from their fellow burglars, to ensure it remained undiscovered.</p><p>But whatever obscure agenda James McCord was working to, it was clearly nothing to do with Richard Nixon or bugging the Democrats. The official story makes so little sense because it simply isn’t true.</p><p>And if this bewildering state of affairs wasn’t already confusing enough, it was about to take an even stranger, deeper, and darker turn.</p><h3>Sabotage</h3><p>The decision to launch a second assault on the Watergate building on June 17 would lead to the discovery of the plot and ultimately the downfall of a president. But as Nixon himself so astutely pointed out, this burglary was so incompetently conducted as to be unbelievable.</p><p>The Watergate team was stuffed full of seasoned, hardboiled covert CIA and FBI operatives. Would they really be caught red handed executing a simple break in?</p><p>An unsettling suspicion rears its head. Did some members of the team deliberately ensure the plot was discovered? Was the burglary sabotaged from within, perhaps even to set-up Nixon for a fall?</p><p>A close examination of Hunt and McCord’s behavior that night suggests exactly that.</p><p>A 20 year veteran of clandestine CIA operations, Hunt made the unbelievable decision to leave a briefcase full of incriminating documents in one of the Cuban burglars hotel rooms at the Watergate.</p><p>The documents, including an address book, linked the Cubans directly to Hunt and the White House. Equally bizarrely, Hunt instructed the men to take their hotel keys with them to the burglary, guaranteeing Nixon would be implicated if they were caught.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/nixon-impeachment-protest.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Once Nixon was implicated in the burglary protesters demanded his impeachment</div></figcaption></figure><p>McCord’s sabotage was more nebulous but even more calamitous. In his role as lookout, he failed to notify his cohorts that the coast was clear at the DNC offices for almost an hour. Had he done so, they likely would not have been caught and the Watergate scandal would never have occurred.</p><p>Instead, McCord, from his vantage point at the opposite Howard Johnson hotel, told his colleague the building was still occupied, which was a lie. But that was only the beginning of his duplicity.</p><p>McCord was also tasked with placing tape over the locks of the stairwell doors at the Watergate to ease the passage of the burglars. He chose to do so in a way that would ensure their discovery.</p><p>Instead of taping them vertically, on the inside edge of the door, where the tape would not be visible to guards, he did so horizontally, across the front face of the door, in a way which would clearly noticed.</p><p>The conclusion that McCord was determined the taped doors would be discovered by guards is unavoidable. He taped doors two floors up from the DNC, at the offices of the Federal Reserve, where he knew the guards were more vigilant.</p><p>There is no suggestion that the Federal Reserve was ever a target for the burglars, so McCord’s taping of their doors is inexplicable unless the intention was to alert security to the presence of the men.</p><p>McCords initial door taping was discovered by the building’s guard Frank Willis. Suspicious, but unsure what to do, Willis stalled for over an hour whilst he consulted colleagues about the situation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/watergate-hotel-security-log.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Watergate security duty log shows that Frank Willis called the police at 1:47AM</div></figcaption></figure><p>During this time, the other conspirators wanted to abort the operation, but McCord ensured them that the guards would simply presume the tape had been added by cleaners.</p><p>It was here that McCord made his most egregious act of sabotage. Having prompted his colleagues to continue the burglary, he re-taped the doors. This, more than anything, ensured their capture.</p><p>The building’s security guards, on rechecking the locks, discovered they had been retaped and were left with no other conclusion than that there was a burglary in action. The police were called. The men were caught. The rest is history.</p><p>McCords bizarre conduct had left his colleagues, the investigators, reports and the history books utterly baffled. What was really going on?</p><h3>The Motive</h3><p>There are two plausible explanations, not necessarily exclusive to one another, for the sabotage of the Watergate burglary.</p><p>Aside from the miasma of contradictory, inconsistent and self-serving personal accounts from the Watergate 7 about what happened that night, we have very little hard evidence that might attest to the burglaries true purpose.</p><p>One such piece of evidence is a key, found on the person of Eugenio Martinez after his arrest. The key, completely unknown to investigators and not publicly revealed until Jim Hougan’s book Secret Agenda in 1984, fit the desk of DNC secretary Ida Wells.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/democratic-national-committe-office.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The men broke into the DNC, but their motives remain a mystery</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hougan and other authors have speculated that the real purpose of the burglary was to gather information from Wells’ desk regarding a call girl ring operating from the adjacent Columbia Plaza Apartments.</p><p>If so, it may be that the hapless burglars had stumbled upon a top secret CIA operation. Possibly an operation run from the Office of Security, designed to gather sexual dirt on high-ranking senators and diplomats.</p><p>Suddenly McCord and Hunt’s actions begin to make sense. The pair, having never really left the agency, sabotaged the Watergate burglary to protect an extremely sensitive clandestine CIA operation.</p><p>Alternatively, or perhaps as an additional bonus, the discovery of the burglary would inevitably lead back to the White House. Pliant assets in the media, such as the intelligence connected Bob Woodward at the Washington Post, and a hostile political establishment could ensure the investigation went straight to the top — Richard Nixon.</p><p>Nixon, alongside his secretary of state Henry Kissinger, had infuriated both the CIA and military top brass for effectively running a secret government from the Oval Office, with little reference to the agency or the joint chiefs of staff.</p><p>The discovery of the Watergate burglars and their obvious links to the White House would at the least undermine Nixon’s administration, if not destroy it.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>Self sacrifice</h3><p>Whilst it seems undeniable that the Watergate operation was sabotaged from within, a serious, even fatal flaw to the theory is the consequences for its protagonists — James W McCord and E Howard Hunt.</p><p>Both men, with families and comfortable lifestyles, went to prison for their part in the conspiracy. It seems a real stretch to suggest either, whatever their secret agenda, was willing to serve serious jail time for it.</p><p>Hunt, improbably, left behind a stack of incriminating evidence in one of the Cuban burglar’s hotel rooms, directing linking both him and the White House to the crime.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors/richard-nixon-press-conference.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Nixon was directly implicated to the crime and could not save himself</div></figcaption></figure><p>McCord sabotaged the burglary whilst he himself was still in the building, ready to be caught red handed by the police. But his subsequent behaviour, he turned on his conspirators and revealed the whole plot to investigators to get a reduced sentence, strongly suggests he was not keen on a stretch.</p><p>Could it be the pair had intended to set up their cohorts but remain undetected themselves? Even seasoned spies like Hunt and McCord make mistakes, after all.</p><p>With both men now dead, we’ll probably never know their real motives. One of the strangest and most perplexing crimes of the 20th century remains an enigma, the truth forever lost in a wilderness of mirrors.</p>","tile":"the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors","path":"the-watergate-conspiracy-wilderness-of-mirrors","date":"2018-02-23T20:17:12.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 23, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"The Watergate Conspiracy","subheadline":"Wilderness <span>of Mirrors</span>","snippet":"Did the Watergate scandal hide a secret agenda?","tags":["Watergate","Nixon","conspiracy","CIA","President","E Howard Hunt","James McCord","burglary","mystery","espionage","spying","intelligence","key"],"title":"The Watergate Conspiracy - Wilderness of Mirrors","tileheadline":"Wilderness of Mirrors"},{"body":"<figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-misskelley-baldwin-mugshots.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Police mugshots of Damian Echols, Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin</div></figcaption></figure><p>Few people who have watched the documentary film Paradise Lost remain unconvinced by its central tenet, that the young men imprisoned in 1994 for the murder of three boys at Robin Hood Hills in West Memphis, Arkansas, were wrongly convicted.</p><p>The film makes a persuasive case that the accused men - Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin suffered a miscarriage of justice; victims of a prejudiced police and legal system that discriminated against them because they were weird kids who dressed in black and liked heavy metal music.</p><p>It's an all too familiar story, and one those in the audience for true crime documentaries are predisposed to believe.  Many similar films have documented sad true stories of minorities, misfits and outsiders been railroaded and wrongly convicted of heinous crimes by small minded, conservative legal systems.</p><p>The films thesis follows the familiar pattern. Damien Echols and his friends were scary and strange teenagers, who liked heavy metal music and even indulged in satanic rituals in the woods. When three young boys are murdered and dumped, hog-tied and naked in local woodland, provincial-minded police quickly focused, with scant evidence, on the teenagers as the likely perpetrators.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/paradise-lost-trilogy.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Paradise Lost films were influential in publicising the case</div></figcaption></figure><p>The small minded local community turned on the accused, false testimony and confessions were suborned by the police and, with the recent Satanic panic scare still in people's minds, prosecutors distorted facts and unfairly used the boys lifestyle and demeanour against them at the trial.</p><p>But what if the prejudice in this case was the other way round? What if the real distortions and manipulations were committed by the films, rather than the prosecution? Is it possible there was a genuine case against the three men, one that is a lot stronger than depicted in Paradise Lost? Could liberal audiences, rightly outraged by similar miscarriages, have rushed to their own judgments?</p><p>This possibility has been almost entirely overlooked by the extraordinary juggernaut created by Paradise Lost. From the original 1996 documentary by directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, its sequels, several other films and the advocacy of major Hollywood figures such as Johnny Depp and Peter Jackson, a huge innocence campaign was spawned that eventually led to the men's release in 2011.</p><p>Although never actually exonerated of the crime, so great was the negative publicly generated against the Arkansaw justice system that an unusual and little-used legal technicality was negotiated between the defense team and the state and the three men were finally released after serving 18 years of their sentences.</p><p>It's not hard to see why the ordeal of the West Memphis Three has had such strong impact on the public consciousness, and why the three men's case has continued to be promoted by high-profile figures in the film and music world such as Henry Rollins, the band Metallica, and director Peter Jackson, who donated $10 million to their defense.</p><p>The story fixed in the public mind by Paradise Lost and its sequels, of troubled teenagers persecuted because they were different, is one millions of people around the world can identify and sympathize with, not least those in the creative industries.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/west-memphis-three-release.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Echols, Misskelley and Baldwin on the day of their release</div></figcaption></figure><p>But with so much myth, propaganda, and rumor having been spread since the three men were jailed in 1994 it's easy to forget exactly why they were convicted in the first place. The films and the innocence campaigners have done such a good job of editing out many of the inconvenient facts and evidence that many are unaware that a solid case exists against the men at all.</p><p>Could it be those original detectives and prosecutors, most of whom maintain the men are guilty, were right after all? To understand why Hollywood may have made a grave mistake in their advocacy of the West Memphis Three, we must travel back to a nightmare day in 1993, when this terrible story begins.</p><p>Police in the small Arkansas city of West Memphis were first alerted that something was wrong on the night of May 5th 1993.  The parents of three local boys had reported their sons, 8-year-olds Steve Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers, missing. A small search was conducted in the surrounding area but no trace of the children was found.</p><p>Concern for the boys deepened after they had still not been found by the following morning and a major search was launched by the police and Crittenden County Search and Rescue at 8:00am. A police helicopter swept the whole area and 50 searchers, including many local volunteers, focused on an area of woods in West Memphis called Robin Hood Hills.</p><p>That afternoon, the grimmest of discoveries was made. Parole officer Steve Jones found a black tennis show near to where the woods bordered the Blue Beacon car wash. In a nearby ditch, Sergeant Mike Allen then discovered the naked body of a boy, his hands tied together with shoelaces. Following the course of the ditch, the bound bodies of two more boys were soon found.</p><p>The boys clothes were found scattered around the creek, some items had been pushed into the mud with sticks and the trousers were inside out. One of the boys, later identified as Chris Byers, was covered in lacerations and had had the skin from his penis and scrotum removed.</p><p>The autopsies found that Chris Byers had died from knife wounds and Steve Branch and Michael Moore from drowning. Luminol tests revealed enough blood on the ground to indicate they were probably killed where they were found. A lack of tracks or drag marks also indicated the boys had been attacked and killed in the woods.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/michael-moore-steve-branch-chris-byers.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Victims Michael Moore, Steve Branch and Chris Byers</div></figcaption></figure><p>The fact there were three victims, and they were tied up with three different types of knots, pointed to multiple killers. Although only 8 years old, it was difficult to see how one man could have subdued and murdered the three boys without at least one of them escaping and calling for help.</p><p>With stories that satanic ceremonies were occurring in the woods already circulating in the local community, the idea there was some ritual element in the murders quickly spread. Steve Jones and another juvenile parole office, Jerry Driver, immediately suspected a troubled local 18-year-old man named Damien Echols.</p><p>Echols' history of psychiatric problems and strange, violent behavior singled him out to Driver. With EVIL tattooed across his knuckles, his black clothes and self-confessed interest in the occult, the teenager also outraged Driver's conservative, insular mindset.  The day after the murders, Driver made his suspicions about Echols known to the West Memphis Police.</p><p>The innocence campaign has made legitimate criticisms about the blinkered attitude of people like Steve Jones and Jerry Driver. Much of their aversion to Echols was based on petty prejudice rather than hard facts. However, once the police were made aware of the teenager, a very real case quickly developed against him, and one nothing to do with how he dressed.</p><p>Police first interviewed Damien Echols on May 7th and would talk to him several times in the next few days. Echols told them he was at home the night of the murders and spent much of the evening talking on the phone with several of his girlfriends.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/ditch-location-of-bodies2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The muddy ditch where two of the boys were found</div></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from his alibi, some of Echols statements in these interviews are strange and alarming enough to naturally attract the suspicion of detectives. Whilst Echols denied any knowledge of the murders, he appeared to have some startling insights into the killers.</p><p>West Memphis police detective Bryn Ridge's notes state - \"When asked about how he thought the person felt that had done the homicides, he stated that the person probably felt good about what he had done and that he felt good that he had the power to do what he had done. \"</p><p>The teenager also had something to say about the killer's methodology - \"Damien stated that he figured that the killer knew the kids went into the woods and even asked them to come out to the woods. He stated that the boys were not big, not smart, and they would have been easy to control. He also felt the killer would not have been worried about the boys screaming due to it being in the woods and close to the expressway.\"</p><p>Innocence advocates have dismissed these statements by Echols as simply a cocky, intelligent teenager been smart with local cops, whom he probably regarded as his intellectual inferior. Whilst this is clearly a possibility, with three children having just been murdered, no detective could reasonably make the same determination.</p><p>Echols' interviews in the days following the murders also brought another name to the attention of the police, a 16-year-old friend of his named Jason Baldwin. Unlike Echols, nothing Baldwin told the detectives stood out as particularly unusual.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-1993.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">18-year-old Damien Echols in 1993</div></figcaption></figure><p>It was a phone call received by the police on May 9th that really turned Echols into a major suspect.  Narlene Hollingsworth, the aunt of Damien's girlfriend Domini Teer, called the West Memphis Police to report a sighting of Echols near the murder scene on the night of the killings.</p><p>According to Narlene and three other members of her family, they saw Echols at around 9:30pm, walking in an area very close to where the bodies were later found. He was also 'covered in mud'.</p><p>It is one of Paradise Lost's most egregious distortions that it casts the police's focus on Echols as unwarranted. The West Memphis Police's honesty and competence have been repeatedly questioned over the years, but by May 10th they had genuine reason to believe that Echols was both lying to them about his alibi, and was near the murder scene at the time the boys died. Knowing this, no police force in the country could regard him as anything other than a major suspect.</p><p>The case against Echols developed further when the name of another local teenager, 17-year-old Jessie Misskelley, came to the police's attention. Misskelley's role in the story would perhaps become the most controversial and debated aspect of the entire case, and pivotal to the arguments of both the innocent and guilty camps.</p><p>Misskelley was a local dropout who worked odd jobs, had a low IQ and a history of petty crime and violence. Police first talked to him as a witness on June 3rd. Sensationally, within hours Misskelley would confess to the entire crime, stating that he, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin had beaten and murdered the boys.</p><p>On the basis of the confession, Misskelley, and the other two suspects were arrested and charged with the murders. Misskelley's statements would form one of the cornerstones of the case against the three men. Because of this, Paradise Lost and the innocence campaign also focus on Misskelley and his confessions, arguing they were coerced by the police.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/newspaper-report-charged.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The three teenagers are charged with the murders</div></figcaption></figure><p>According to Paradise Lost, Misskelley was a vulnerable minor, a teenager with a very low IQ and learning difficulties who was interrogated for 12 hours on his own without his parents or legal representation. Under intense pressure from detectives, Misskelley falsely confessed to a crime he and his two friends did not commit.</p><p>This false confession narrative is central to the entire innocence campaign, but it is seriously misrepresented in the films. In actual fact, Jessie Misskelley confesses multiple times, often in private to his own defense lawyers and away from police pressure.</p><p>Similarly misleading is the way the films treat Misskelley's alleged intellectual dysfunction and the circumstances surrounding his police interviews. Even when Paradise Lost makes a valid point, it is often undermined by its one-sided treatment of the facts and omission of proper context to what's happening.</p><p>Because he was accusing the other two suspects, Misskelley was tried separately from Echols and Baldwin. Despite the shortcomings of the prosecution case alleged by the innocence campaign, two separate juries in 1994 were sufficiently convinced to convict the three men. Echols was sentenced to death and Baldwin and Misskelley were sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p>None of the films make any attempt to interview the jury members to try and understand why they thought the men were guilty, settling instead to insinuate that they were gullible and prejudiced for doing so.</p><p>The first Paradise Lost film was released in 1996, building on an inchoate campaign that was developing on the then emerging internet. Sequels released in 2000 and 2011 follow supporters of the men and their attempts to get the verdicts overturned.</p><p>West of Memphis, produced by Peter Jackson and Damien Echols himself, was released in 2012. Covering much the same ground as  Paradise Lost, the film concludes with the deal made between prosecutors and the defense team that saw the men released in 2011.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-west-of-memphis.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Damien Echols in a scene from West of Memphis, which he produced with Peter Jackson</div></figcaption></figure><p>The rarely used Alford plea allowed the men to be released on the condition that they admit the state had enough evidence to convict them should the case go to another trial. Essentially it allowed Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley to protest their innocence for the cameras whilst officially pleading guilty to the crime.</p><p>These later films have attracted criticisms for making allegations against some of the murdered boys fathers. Suspicion is cast variously upon both John Mark Byers and Terry Hobbs, often using the same kind of scant evidence and innuendo the film-makers accused the prosecution of using.</p><p>The case of the West Memphis Three would probably be unknown outside of Arkansas if not for these films and especially the high profile support Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley have received from the film and music industry.</p><p>Their advocacy catapulted the relatively obscure case into an international cause celebre, cited as a notorious miscarriage of justice in countless newspaper stories, magazine articles, books and television programs. West Memphis itself was widely depicted as a rural backwater with a corrupt and incompetent police and courts.</p><blockquote><span>\"I concluded, and am still convinced, that they were guilty\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Little attention was paid to dissenting voices. Award-winning journalist Billy Sinclair began writing about crime and justice whilst serving a 40-year prison sentence for murder in the 1970s. Now released, Sinclair believes the West Memphis Three are guilty.</p><p>“I concluded, and am still convinced, that they were guilty,” he said. \"My gut feeling is that if a person is truly innocent, who has spent 18 years fighting for his innocence, he’s not going to go and plead guilty to killing three 8-year-old boys unless he’s guilty.\"</p><p>Are skeptics like Sinclair right? Were the West Memphis Three guilty of the murders of the children at Robin Hood Hills in 1993?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>Killing Time</h3><p>The murders were thought to have occurred sometime between about 6:30pm, when the boys were last seen, and 8pm. Although glossed over in Paradise Lost, none of the men have been able to produce a convincing alibi for this time.</p><p>In his May 10th interview, Echols states that was at home all night, talking to various girls on the phone. However, when police found and interviewed the four girls named in Echols' statement, they all contradicted his account.</p><p>13-year-old Jennifer Bearden did talk to Damien a few times that day, but it was not during the time-frame of the murder. In her statement she says she called Echols at around 8pm but his grandmother answered and said he was out.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-trailer.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Echols claimed to be at home in this trailer during the murders but his alibi fell apart under scrutiny</div></figcaption></figure><p>Two other girls, Heather Cliett and Holly George, also talked to Echols by phone that day, but were unable to contact him between about 9 and 10:30pm. The next day Holly later told Heather that Damien said he had been out \"walking around\" at the time.</p><p>Even more damaging for Echols is the testimony of the Hollingsworth family. Narlene Hollingsworth, along with three members of her family, were driving in the area of Robin Hood Hills at around 9:30pm when they saw Echols with his girlfriend Domini Teer walking along a road just 200 yards from where the bodies were found. According to the family, Echols was \"covered in mud\".</p><p>All four of the Hollingsworth family knew Echols well, and their sighting was, and remains, a major problem for the innocence campaign. Not only does it place Damien Echols near the murder site at around the time the boys were killed, it contradicts his own alibi. The fact the murdered boys were found dumped in a muddy ditch also casts the observation that Echols was covered in mud in a further suspicious light.</p><p>Echols has continued to lie about his alibi in his many media interviews. In 2010, he told CNN - \"At the time the police say the murders took place I was actually on the phone with three different people.  The problem was, my attorneys never called them to the stand.\"</p><p>Clearly, if Echols' lawyers had evidence that he was elsewhere when the crimes occurred then they would have used it. That they don't call the girls is because they would have contradicted their client's alibi, an inconvenient fact that both Damien Echols and the Paradise Lost films are keen we don't know.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/ditch-location-of-bodies.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The muddy ditch where two of the bodies were found</div></figcaption></figure><p>There's also no reason to believe the defense team wouldn't have had access to the phone records for that night. Tellingly, since Echols would probably have been acquitted if the phone alibi story was true, they don't use them.</p><p>Jason Baldwin's alibi proved too flimsy and inconsistent to use at trial. His lawyers found it so difficult to piece together any coherent timeline of Jason's whereabouts on the day that they took the unusual course of not presenting any alibi witnesses at all.</p><p>One of the defence team lawyers, Paul Ford, explained this decision in 2008 - \"I concluded from my efforts that I did not find successfully what I was looking for, for the purposes of establishing an alibi that I felt would not unravel on me, which I believe is much more detrimental than not presenting one at all.\"</p><p>Jessie Misskelley's alibi initially looked stronger. His defence attorneys found several people who were willing to testify that Misskelley was attending a wrestling game in Dyess at the time of the murders. The wrestling story features prominently in Paradise Lost and West of Memphis, but the films leave out some important context.</p><p>In actual fact, the alibi largely crumbled under cross-examination, as the witnesses were inconsistent and contradicted each other. The prosecution team also produced a receipt which suggested the trip had probably occurred in April, before the murders. Tellingly, Misskelley never mentions the wrestling trip in any of his police statements</p><p>Is it really credible that none of the three accused men are able to provide a good alibi for the most infamous night in West Memphis history? Real innocent people are obviously somewhere else, and they leave a trace behind. If the men really are not guilty, then they are incredibly unlucky to be unable to convincingly account for their true whereabouts.</p><h3>Am I Evil?</h3><p>The films, and latterly Echols himself, have done a good job in portraying the then 18-year-old as an outsider who was persecuted in a small Christian community because he was a goth who had an interest in the occult. They concede he was suffering from angst and mild depression, but these are perfectly normal teenage problems.</p><p>What the innocence campaign studiously avoid is the fact that Echols was actually mentally ill at the time of the murders, a self-confessed psychopath with a long history of serious psychiatric problems.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-trial.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Damien Echols at his trial in 1994</div></figcaption></figure><p>Echols had been hospitalised for mental health issues twice the previous year, his behaviour often so extreme his own parents had become frightened of him. They told Echols' case worker that they were \"frightened of him and what he can do, not only to them but to other children that reside in the home.\"</p><p>During the sentencing phase of the trial when it was apparent that Echols may face the death penalty, his defence team prepared a large dossier, known as Exhibit 500, detailing his psychiatric history over the previous few years. This was a standard procedure as it could be used as a mitigating factor in order to reduce a death sentence to life imprisonment.</p><p>This document had unintended consequences when it was made public due to the catalogue of aberrant behavior it detailed. Although downplayed by his advocates, the dossier details the deeply troubled mind of a young man teetering on the edge of psychopathy, who was prone to violence and suffering delusions of grandeur.</p><p>The report recounts Echols frequent homicidal and suicidal thoughts, how he was obsessed with satanism and the occult, believed he was possessed by a spirit called Rosey and even believed he was God.</p><p>Echols' frequent aggression was also a major concern. Several expulsion reports from Echols' school detail his routine threats and violence against his classmates. He attacked many of his friends and even tried to gouge out the eye of one boy. Two incidents are documented of him setting fire to his classroom.</p><p>The aggression extended to his family members. Whilst detained at Craighead County Juvenile Detention Center in 1992, a hospital's psychological assessment reported that Echols was - \"presently in detention in Jonesboro, picked up for violation of probation, threatened to slit parents throat and eat them alive.\"</p><p>One recurring theme from the Exhibit 500 is Echols fixation with drinking blood. Several incidents are documented of him licking blood off other patients at hospital and trying to suck blood from people's necks. One particularly disturbing episode is described in his psychological evaluation - \"...one of the kids at the detention hall cut his wrists, Damien grabbed his arm and began to the suck the blood, smeared it over his body and said he’s a devil worshipping vampire.\"</p><blockquote><span>\"...one of the kids at the detention hall cut his wrists, Damien grabbed his arm and began to the suck the blood...\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>Echols himself felt he was so mentally ill that he could not work. At the time of the murders he had applied for and was receiving Social Security disability benefits for his psychiatric issues, describing himself on the application as - \"Homicidal, suicidal, manic depression, schizophrenia, sociopathic\".</p><p>More lurid allegations that Echols murdered and dismembered a dog are difficult to verify, and hotly contested between both the pro and anti camps. However, there is already enough in Exhibit 500 to conclude Echols was a dangerous individual who exhibited enough red flags to believe he was at least capable of doing something as terrible as the murders he was charged with.</p><p>Another recurring feature of Echols' behaviour is his compulsive lying. With the innocence campaign having almost entirely captured the mainstream narrative, Echols has been free to make several obvious and unchallenged lies about the case in many of his media interviews.</p><p>Amongst Echols' most notable lies are his claim in 2010 that he did not live in West Memphis at the time of the murders. As established at the trial, on May 5th 1993, Echols actually lived at the Broadway Trailer Park in West Memphis, about two miles from the murder scene.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/robin-hood-hills.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Despite his later claims, Echols was familiar with Robin Hood Hills and had previously lived nearby</div></figcaption></figure><p>Echols has also stated on several occasions since his release that he  hardly ever visited West Memphis and was not familiar with Robin Hood Hills, where the murders occurred,  This is hard to square with the fact that he had once lived in the Mayfair Apartments, which overlooked the area. The apartments were so close to the murder scene that the crime scene tape was just yards from their front entrance.</p><p>In the 1992-93 timeframe, Echols would often be seen walking around the area of Robin Hood Hills, and even stated so himself at his in trial in 1994. His later attempts to distance himself from the crime scene are part of a wider attempt to rewrite the history of his involvement, something the films, especially the Echols produced West of Memphis, have allowed him to do with impunity.</p><h3>The Memory Remains</h3><p>By far the most egregious misrepresentation in Paradise Lost and its sequels concern Jessie Misskelley's confessions. If the films are to be believed, Misskelley was a man with a very low IQ who was interrogated without representation for 12 hours until he broke down and falsely confessed to the murders.</p><p>The first misrepresentation concerns Misskelley's IQ. It suited the defence case to portray Misskelley as borderline retarded as it re-enforced the narrative that he had been bullied into confessing by the police and his statements could not be trusted.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/jessie-misskelley.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Misskelley confessed multiple times, even to his own lawyers</div></figcaption></figure><p>Undoubtedly Misskelley had quite a low IQ, he scored between 70 and 80 in various tests he was given. However, Misskelley was told by his lawyers a low IQ score would reduce the chance of him getting the death penalty. There is some evidence that his tests show signs of 'malingering', or deliberately acting dumb to try and achieve a low score.</p><p>Regardless of what his IQ tests say, Misskelley was a functional adult. He was literate, held down jobs and had relationships with women. He operated at the level of millions of other Americans who manage to lead normal lives without been particularly smart. He even enrolled in college after his release. He was certainly not the gullible, mentally retarded man-child he was often depicted as by innocence campaigners.</p><p>The key aspect of the false confession narrative advocated by Paradise Lost is that Misskelley was interrogated for 12 hours, without his parents permission or the presence of a lawyer. Even a cursory study of the police records show this to be untrue.</p><p>In actual fact, Misskelley was first contacted by the police as a witness. Sgt Mike Allen talked to his Misskelley's father on the morning of the 3rd of June about interviewing Jessie. His father agreed and went and fetched his son, who was then driven to the police station by Allen. His father knew what was happening with his son at all times. He even went to the station mid-morning to sign a permission form to allow Misskelley to be administered a polygraph test. Misskelley failed the test.</p><p>It is often claimed by innocence advocates that Jessie Misskelley was not read his Miranda rights or did not understand his rights during this interview. This claim had been made so many times that it's become a kind of article of faith, despite the fact it's entirely untrue. The tapes and transcripts of the interview, aswell as two initialed forms, clearly reveal that Misskelley is actually read his rights on multiple occasions during the June 3rd interview.</p><p>Misskelley also fully understood what his rights were. He had had numerous prior encounters with law enforcement and had read and signed Miranda waivers on at least four occasions before. The transcript also reveals that Misskelley was offered, and turned down the opportunity to have a lawyer during this interview.</p><p>Misskelley arrived at the police station at about 10pm. He confessed to the crime at 2:20pm. Only a few hours of this 4 and a half hours actually consisted of interviews. There never was a 12-hour interrogation, it is an invention of the innocence campaign and Paradise Lost.</p><p>False confessions are quite well understood in criminology. They happen under situations of intense stress and pressure and are almost immediately retracted when the suspect is released from the pressure of the interrogation. Misskelley does not fit this pattern at all.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/echols-baldwin.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Aswell as Misskelley, witnesses came forward to say they had heard both Echols and Baldwin make admissions of guilt</div></figcaption></figure><p>After his June 3rd confession, he makes numerous other confessions. Eight days later Misskelley confesses again, in private to his own defence lawyers Dan Stidham and Greg Crow.  In further prison interviews with Stidham in February 1994, Misskelley confesses again, on one occasion with his hand on a bible.</p><p>After his conviction in February, Misskelley again admits he committed the crime to two police officers transporting him to prison. Then, in an extraordinary tape recorded conversation with his attorneys on February 17th , Misskelley stridently reaffirms his guilt as Stidham and Crow can be heard pleading with him not to. He is then interviewed by the prosecution team where he gives a long and detailed account of how he, Baldwin and Echols murdered the boys.</p><p>Paradise Lost and West of Memphis fail to mention the 17th February confession, or the many other confessions Misskelley made. They don't fit the narrative of a mentally inadequate man been coerced into confessing by vicious police bullying. No explanation has ever been given as to how a man who apparently is coerced into falsely confessing is also able to confidently and defiantly resist the coercion of his own lawyers not to confess.</p><p>Some evidence exists to suggest Misskelley confessed even before the police first talked to him. A friend of Jessie Misskelley named Buddy Lucas told police that on May 6th Misskelley told him he was present when the boys were murdered. Lucas stated that Misskelley broke down and cried whilst talking to him. Numerous other witnesses, including Miskelley's father's girlfriend reported similar uncharacteristic crying fits from teenager in the days following the murders.</p><p>Although less central to the case, there were also some accounts of confessions to the crimes from Echols and Baldwin. Two peripheral friends of the boys, William Winford and Ken Watkins both reported to police that they had heard Echols claim responsibility for the murders.</p><p>A group of girls at a softball game also reported hearing Damien Echols brag about the crimes. Echols denied making the statements at his trial, and innocence campaigners have long rubbished the girls testimony. However, in later years, Echols admitted he did brag about killing the boys at the softball game, but stated he probably said it as a 'joke'.</p><h3>Knife in the Water</h3><p>It is often claimed that no physical evidence connects the West Memphis Three to the murder of the boys at Robin Hood Hills. However, a knife found in the lake behind Jason Baldwin's trailer provided a solid, if not entirely undisputed, link between the teenager and the crimes.</p><p>In November 1993, while the suspects were awaiting trial, West Memphis police began a search for evidence relating to the crime and quickly focused in on a large area of water behind the trailer park where Jason Baldwin lived at the time of the murders. This looked a likely place where possible murder weapons may have been disposed.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/lakeshore.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The knife was found in the large pond backing off the trailer park Jason Baldwin lived in at the time of the murders</div></figcaption></figure><p>Police divers found various items in the lake, including footwear and a jacket. Amongst the items was a large survival type knife with a serrated edge and a circular opening in the base of the handle that had one held a screw in compass.</p><p>Police believed the saw like serrated edge of the knife matched some of regularly spaced, incised wounds observed on the bodies of Chris Byers and Steven Branch. At the trial, prosecution lawyers famously attempted to demonstrate how this knife could have made the wounds by using it on a grapefruit.</p><p>The prosecution also called witnesses who claimed to have seen the knife in Jason Baldwin's trailer around the time of the murders. Deanna Holcomb, Damien Echols' ex-girlfriend, also told the court that she had previously seen Echols with a similar knife.</p><p>The defense team and innocence advocates have tried to counter the knife evidence in various ways over the years. They have dismissed the knife like marks on the boys bodies as teeth marks or animal predation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/lake-knife.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Testimony linked the knife to Baldwin and Echols</div></figcaption></figure><p>Paradise Lost 2 tries to argue some of the wounds were human bite marks and insinuates they were made by John Mark Byers, whose eccentric behaviour and recent dental surgery had caused rumours to spread in the local community that he may have been involved in the murders.</p><p>More recently, two forensic dentists have re-examined autopsy photos of the wounds and dismissed the bite mark thesis. Homer Campbell and Peter Loomis are both specialists in tool and bite mark identification who have given expert testimony in several court cases over the years. They both believe the wounds to the boys were produced by the so-called lake knife.</p><p>\"I believe the injuries to the left forehead and upper lid of the left eye were produced by the knife recovered or one similar. I also sent the photos of the injuries and the knife to another for evaluation and he agrees\", Campbell stated.</p><p>Loomis measured the wounds to Steve Branch's forehead and found they corresponded exactly to the dimensions of the knife. \"The 3 lacerations under the eyebrow look like they were made by the serrations on the back side of the knife. The lacerations measure 11.2mm between them, and the serrated points on the knife vary between 11.1 and 11.4 mm\".</p><p>The circular butt of the Baldwin knife, measuring 29.8mm in diameter, also matched almost exactly the 30mm diameter of the circular wound that had been dismissed by the defence as a bite mark. The extraordinary way the size of the wounds precisely match the dimensions of the knife is striking.</p><p>Whilst speculation, if this knife had made the injuries to Branch's forehead whilst the compass section was still intact, then the metal pin at the centre of the compass would also match exactly the clear x-shaped mark at the centre of the wound.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/wound-knife.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The knife matches the wounds to Steve Branch perfectly</div></figcaption></figure><p>The knife is problematic for innocence advocates. It provides a solid forensic link between Jason Baldwin and the fatal wounds to Steven Branch. But like so much in the crime, this evidence is still far from conclusive and remains heavily disputed.</p><p>But if a knife almost exactly matching the size and nature of the wounds was found in the water behind Jason Baldwin's trailer entirely by coincidence, and it is unrelated to either the men or the crime, then yet again the West Memphis Three have been extraordinarily unlucky.</p><h2>Evidence Against</h2><h3>Sad But True</h3><p>At the trial, the prosecution presented several pieces of forensic evidence linking the suspects to the crime. The innocence campaign and the Paradise Lost films have rightly pointed out how weak much of this evidence is. The truth is, with the possible exception of the lake knife as discussed, no physical evidence firmly links either the West Memphis Three or any other suspect to the crimes.</p><p>Attorneys often bemoan the expectation modern juries have for DNA and forensic evidence in murder trials. This expectation has become known as the CSI Effect, fostered by the widespread use of often exaggerated crime scene forensics in films and television shows.</p><p>In reality, even today in an era of extremely sophisticated DNA techniques, very few criminal cases revolve around forensic evidence. One study has only 13% of criminal cases having any kind of forensic evidence at all, and it's estimated that usable DNA evidence is left behind in only 4.5% of homicides.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/police-search.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Police found very little usable forensic evidence at the scene</div></figcaption></figure><p>The lack of DNA evidence at the murder site in Robin Hood Hills is sometimes cited as an argument for the boys innocence, but the truth is the absence of such evidence is much as would be expected, especially so because the boys were killed outdoors. Not only was the crime scene heavily contaminated by searchers and investigators, but the killers also dumped the bodies in water which washed off any forensic evidence that may have been present.</p><p>What evidence there was was inadequate as a serious argument for the men's guilt. Fibre evidence presented by the prosecution was too vague and could have matched almost anyone, not just the suspects. Some of the other evidence used by the prosecution was tendentious at best.</p><p>Blue candle wax found on one of the victims clothing was only similar to wax found in Echols' bedroom, and could have matched any number of other people who had candles in their home. DNA evidence found on Echols' necklace was consistent with that of Steven Branch, but also millions of other people.</p><h3>Eye of the Beholder</h3><p>Whilst the frequent claim that Jessie Misskelley was coerced into confessing is not supported by the evidence, much of what he says is undermined by its inaccuracy. A large amount of Misskelley's confession does not match the known details of the crime and Paradise Lost and the innocence campaign have done a good job in highlighting the manifest inconsistencies in his statements.</p><p>Whilst he does get some important details correct, there are enough major discrepancies to make it hard to reconcile them with Misskelley actually been present during the murders. Several times in his confessions he states that the victims were tied up with brown rope. This is untrue, they were tied up with their own shoelaces.</p><p>If Misskelley was present could he really have gotten such a basic detail wrong? The rope statement does sound like someone trying to imagine or guess how the crime was committed rather than having real first-hand knowledge. Misskelley almost certainly heard the many rumours about the crimes that were circulating in the area and this may also have coloured his statements.</p><p>Numerous similar factual discrepancies have been highlighted by innocence campaigners and are prominently featured in the Paradise Lost films. Misskelley tells police they skipped school that day and killed the boys around noon. They were actually killed in the late evening. He states that he witnessed Baldwin and Echols rape the boys, but the autopsies showed that this did not occur.</p><p>There are some possible explanations for the inconsistencies in Misskelley's statements. By his own admission he was very drunk during the attacks, and the liquor bottle he says he threw under a bridge was later found by the police. He also admits to only been peripherally involved in the murders themselves. It's at least plausible that a combination of intoxication and distance from the acts of murder themselves account for his inaccuracies.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1201\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/the-west-memphis-three-a-deal-with-the-devil/misskelley-mugshot.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Jessie Misskelley's mugshot from his arrest in 1993</div></figcaption></figure><p>We must also bear in mind that Misskelley, even if he was involved, was also a witness to a crime. Even genuine eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable and often give details that prove to be entirely untrue. This is not evidence they did not witness the crime, just that the human memory is faulty and that when people are involved in shocking, chaotic and confusing events their recollections of them are often massively out of kilter with what actually happened.</p><p>The case of the West Memphis Three is a miasma of claim and counter claim. The murders are still fiercely debated online, largely curated by those who passionately believe in the innocence of the convicted men. The discussion is often bad-tempered with little ground given on either side.</p><p>There is no doubt that the campaign kicked off by Paradise Lost in 1996 has proven to be one of the most successful in legal history. It led to the release of the men, created global outrage about their plight and tainted the community of West Memphis with a lasting shame. This has lead to a great deal of resentment in the town about how they have been depicted in the media.</p><p>Whether the men are guilty or innocent may never be determined. Perhaps only another confession or the capture of the real killers will settle the matter once and for all.

A few weeks after Carnarvon’s death, Carter gave wealthy financier George J Gould a private tour of he tomb. Soon after, Gould came down with a fever and died.</p><p>Other early tomb visitors died violent or strange deaths within the year. Prince Ali Kemal Fahmy Bey and South African millionaire Woolf Joel were both murdered and British MP Aubrey Herbert went blind and died of blood poisoning.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/tutankhamun-curse-of-the-mummy/carter-remove-treasure-tutankhamun-tomb.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Carter and his workers remove the treasures - did they provoke the pharaoh’s wrath?</div></figcaption></figure><p>Hebert’s death was particularly tragic for the Carnarvon family as he was Lord Carnarvon’s half brother. He had reported on entering the burial chamber - “something dreadful is going to happen to our family”.</p><p>Perhaps the press were right? Within months, a disparate group of characters from around the world were all dead after visiting the tomb.</p><p>The following year, 1924, would only fuel the speculation. In January, Sir Archibald Douglas-Reid, who had x-rayed King Tutankhamun’s body, died from a mysterious illness.</p><p>H. E. Evelyn-White was next. The young British archeologist was one of the first to enter the tomb after Carter. After writing - “I have succumbed to a curse” in his own blood, he hung himself.</p><p>Sir Lee Stack, governor of Sudan, was also amongst the earliest visitors to the pharaoh’s tomb. Later that year he too met a violent end, shot dead on the streets of Cairo by an assassin.</p><p>The next year one of the most peculiar stories surrounding the curse hit the news-stands. Howard Carter had given his close friend, Sir Bruce Ingham, a paperweight made from a mummified hand wearing a scarab bracelet.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/tutankhamun-curse-of-the-mummy/tutankhamun-dig-site.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The dig site has notable visitors from all around the world.</div></figcaption></figure><p>Inscribed upon the bracelet were the words - “cursed be he who moves my body.

When it was rebuilt, it flooded.</p><p>In 1926, George Benedite of the Louvre museum died shortly after visiting the tomb. Another Egyptologist, Aaron Ember, also died that year in a curious fire at his home.</p><p>After Howard Carter himself, the main archeologist to excavate Tutankhamun’s tomb was A. C. Mace. Mace spent years on the dig and co-authored the first book about discovery with Carter.</p><p>In 1928, after complaining of increasing weakness, he collapsed. He died shortly later, seemingly of arsenic poisoning, in the same hospital as Lord Carnarvon.</p><p>1929 saw two particularly strange deaths.

But this time it pointed to a scientific solution to the mystery.</p><p>Sheryl Munsun died in 1995 of respiratory failure, a few weeks after visiting Tutankhamun’s tomb. Munson didn’t just visit the tomb, she touched the walls and run her fingers across the paint.</p><p>Back home, she fell ill. Her immune system, already weakened by a battle with cancer, had become overrun by spores or a toxic fungus - Aspergillus Niger.</p><p>Doctors were baffled. Could there be any connection to her recent trip to Egypt?

It was the second letter from someone claiming to be the killer, but this time he gave himself his soon to be legendary name — ‘The Zodiac’.</p><p>More murders would follow, along with more letters to local newspapers and police. The Zodiac’s terrible crimes were been publically played out in the nation’s newspapers, with each twist and turn holding the American public under a grim spell.</p><p>And then he stopped.

The letters continued, filled with boasts and taunts, and other murders would occasionally be linked to the Zodiac but, officially at least, he seemed to have had his fill of killing.</p><p>At the time of the original police investigation, some detectives were skeptical the crimes were related, but mainly on account of the letters the general consensus was that a serial killer was at work around San Fransisco.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-killer-letter.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Zodiac killer, as yet unnamed, wrote his first letter to Bay Area newspapers on July 31, 1969.</div></figcaption></figure><p>But despite the conviction they were after one man, the police departments of multiple jurisdictions were unable to develop a credible suspect.

In this letter, the writer christens himself ‘The Zodiac’.</p><p>On September 27 1969, Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were tied up and stabbed multiple times by a man on the shore of Lake Berryessa near Napa, California. Shepard died 2 days later in hospital, but Hartnell survived and was able to give a description of his attacker.</p><p>According to Hartnell the man wore a strange costume — a black hood and bib, and claimed to be an escaped convict. Tieing the pair up, he stabbed them both repeatedly, then hiked a quarter of a mile to where the pair had parked their car and left a message on the door.</p><p>The message contained the dates of both this and the previous 2 attacks, and the murder weapon used in each. It was signed with the same circle-crosshair logo present on the letters. About 90 minutes later, someone phoned the Napa County Sherrif’s office to claim responsibility for the attack.</p><p>On October 11 1969, at around 10pm, cab driver Paul Stine was shot to death by his passenger in the Presidio Heights district of San Francisco. The killer took Stine’s wallet and keys, wiped down some of the blood from the cab, and fled as police arrived.</p><p>2 days later, a letter was received by the San Francisco Chronicle claiming responsibility for the murder. Alongside the letter, the writer included a piece of Paul Stine’s bloody shirt, offered as proof that he was really responsible.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-sketch-brian-hartnell.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Sketch based on surviving victim Brian Hartnell’s description of the killer</div></figcaption></figure><p>Primarily because of the letters, police believed these 5 murders were committed by the man calling himself the Zodiac. But despite a massive investigation across multiple police departments the case was never solved and the identity of the killer remains unknown to this day.</p><p>Dozens, if not hundreds of different theories have been put forward over the years as to the identity of the Zodiac killer, but to date nobody has ever been able to put together a particularly convincing case against anyone that withstands close scrutiny.</p><p>Of all these theories, the one that has gained most traction amongst the public originates with Robert Graysmith, a true crime writer who worked as a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle during the Zodiac murders.</p><p>In Graysmith's 1986 book ‘Zodiac’, and its sequel ‘Zodiac Unmasked’ the author singles out Arthur Leigh Allen as the Zodiac. Allen was a convicted child molester who was briefly considered a suspect in 1969, but dismissed by the police because they were unable to find any evidence linking him to the murders.</p><p>Despite Graysmith's persistent accusations against Allen, repeatedly made in television interviews, he was almost certainly not the Zodiac. DNA tests on one of the letters did not match him, nor did a handprint found on another. Handwriting experts also could find no match between extensive examples of Allen’s handwriting and the Zodiac letters.</p><p>Since its publication, many experts on the case have thoroughly dismantled Graysmith’s book, exposing it as a mixture of myths, half-truths, and inventions concocted to present a non-existence case against an innocent man.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/arthur-leigh-allen-driving-licence.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Robert Graysmith erroneously accused Arthur Leigh Allen of being the Zodiac killer.</div></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the falsity of Robert Graysmith's claims, it has not stopped them becoming the dominant modern narrative about the Zodiac case, used as the source for countless documentaries and other books. It was also the basis of a 2007 film about the case by director David Fincher.</p><p>With the failure of anyone to find any credible suspects in the case, could the theory that the Zodiac killer was some kind of hoax be right, and the murders attributed to him unrelated?</p><h2>Evidence For</h2><h3>The many signs of the Zodiac</h3><p>If not for the letters and phone calls attributed to the Zodiac killer, it is doubtful the 5 murders the killer claimed responsibility for would ever have been linked by the police.</p><p>Whilst the Lake Herman Road and Lake Berryessa attacks were committed against young couples, the Blue Rocks Springs victims were not a couple. Nor were they, as is often reported, in a ‘lovers lane’ area.</p><p>Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau were actually attacked in a busy parking lot close to a main road, with cars coming and going around them. This was a high-risk location for murder and a far cry from the remote beauty spots where the Zodiac made 2 of his purported attacks.</p><p>The third attack at Lake Berryessa is also quite different in style to the previous two sets of murders. Here, for the one and only time, the Zodiac wears a disguise — a black executioner’s hood with sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib over his chest with the now familiar cross-circle symbol painted on it.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-paul-stine-crime-scene.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Cab driver Paul Stine’s murder looked like an unrelated robbery turned murder</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst laying on the Zodiac imagery thick, he also spends a great deal of time talking with his victims, something he is not known to have done in any of the other murders. This is also the only known attack where he ties up his victims.</p><p>29-year-old Paul Stine was the Zodiac’s last victim, robbed and murdered whilst driving his cab in the middle of a San Fransico street, as bystanders looked on. This attack appears least like the others attributed to the Zodiac, and would have undoubtedly been dismissed as an all-to-common robbery gone wrong if not for the letter writer’s own claims to responsibility.</p><p>All of these seemingly disparate attacks used a different murder weapon. The first murders at Lake Herman Road were thought to have been committed with a .22 automatic pistol. The assailant of Paul Stine and at Blue Rock Springs used different 9mm semi-automatics, and the victims at Lake Berryessa were stabbed with a long knife.</p><p>There was no matching ballistics in any of the crimes attributed to the Zodiac, nor any other solid forensic evidence that linked them. Although fingerprints and palm-prints were lifted at several of the crimes scenes, none of them ever matched each other.</p><p>To all intents and purposes, these appeared to be unrelated murders. Could it be that the Zodiac was not a genuine murderer, but a warped hoaxer claiming credit for unrelated crimes? Or separate criminals adopting the Zodiac’s widely publicised persona as a kind of alibi?</p><p>Clearly, if you commit a crime then blame it on an uncaught high-profile serial killer, a serial killer that could not possibly be you, then you have created a cast iron alibi for the crime you did commit.</p><h3>The usual suspects</h3><p>Although rarely mentioned in the numerous documentaries on the subject or Robert Graysmith’s books, there were strong alternative suspects in several of the individual crimes that were attributed to the Zodiac.</p><p>Solana Country Investigators at the time had good reason to believe the first attack at Lake Herman Road was drug related. 2 informants, in jail for a similar crime the year before, pointed to a drug-dealing associate of theirs named David Wally Ott as the shooter of Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday.</p><p>Police had some corroboration of this ID from another witness and a confirmed account of a confrontation between Faraday and another drug dealer in which Faraday had threatened to turn him into the police.</p><p>Such drug and gang related violence was all-to-common in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 60s — 10 people had been murdered in the previous year alone. If the Zodiac had not effectively ended the investigation by claiming credit for Jensen and Faraday’s deaths, other credible, albeit far less sensational suspects may well have been found.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-darlene-ferrin-james-phillips-crabtree.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Image thought to show Darlene Ferrin with her estranged ex-husband James Phillips Crabtree — was he her killer?</div></figcaption></figure><p>There was also a plethora of possible alternative suspects in the Blue Rock Springs attack on Ferrin and Mageau, including a rogue cop, the same drug gangs that may have been involved in the Lake Herman Road murders and Darlene Ferrin’s ex-husband James Phillips Crabtree.</p><p>If the murder of Ferrin had never been linked to the Zodiac, Crabtree, as her estranged ex-husband, would have been a prime suspect. The pair’s relationship was acrimonious and violent and even after Ferrin’s tragic death Crabtree would continue to talk about her in the most bitter and degrading terms. He was also arrested shortly after her death in the possession of a handgun similar to the one used in the murder.</p><p>Despite the fact it would have been routine for Crabtree to have been considered a prime suspect, amazingly it wasn’t until months later that the police briefly looked into him in connection with Ferrin’s murder, such was the power that the idea of a ‘Zodiac killer’ had on the police investigation.</p><p>If Crabtree was Ferrin’s murderer, what about the letters? 2 factors tentatively suggest the possibility he may have written at least some of the earlier ones.</p><p>As a trained cryptographer, Crabtree had the credentials to have written the ciphers contained in the Zodiac’s first letters. He also uses the Zodiacs trademark circle-crosshairs symbol in a postcard he wrote to an occult bookshop in England sometime in 1969. It’s not clear whether this was posted before or after the symbol appears in the letters, but either way it’s striking.</p><p>Whilst there is little to suggest Crabtree was responsible for any of the other murders, could he have written the letters and added Jensen and Faraday as fictional Zodiac victims to act as a kind of alibi for himself in the murder or Darlene Ferrin?</p><p>It has long been speculated that the third attack at Lake Berryessa may have been a copycat, a twisted and disturbed person taking on the persona of the Zodiac as reported so vividly in the media during the previous weeks.</p><p>Whilst the killer at Lake Berryessa uses the Zodiac’s ‘logo’, and writes a Zodiac like a message on the car door, everything else about the attack only bears a superficial resemblance to the Zodiac’s previous alleged murders.</p><p>This is also the only attack the writer of the letters never mentions, somewhat odd considering his primary motive always appeared to be to take public credit for his work. The change of killing method also singles out Lake Berryessa as unusual.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-lake-berryessa-car-message.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The killer at Lake Berryessa left a message on the victim’s car door</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst by no means unprecedented for a serial killer to change murder technique, moving from shooting to stabbing is quite rare. Shooting is an impersonal and clinical method of killing, giving the gunman a degree of control and distance from his crime.</p><p>Stabbing, however, is up-close, messy and personal, the murderer gets his victims blood on his hands. The contrast between the two methods reveals a very different pathology in the killer and quite possibly a different killer altogether.</p><p>There are other problems in the Lake Berryessa attack. Although the Zodiac left a message on the car door of his victims, no trace of blood is present on the door, despite the fact he had conducted a frenzied knife attack, stabbing Hartnell and Shepard a total of 16 times, just moments before. How had the killer manages to so thoroughly clean his hands?</p><p>The handwriting on the car door also shows some distinct differences between the writing evident in the Zodiac letters, although these could be accounted for by the unusual angle he may have had to adopt to write on the door. Either way, it cannot reliably be tied to the ‘real’ Zodiac in either form or content with any certainty.</p><p>The last murder attributed to the Zodiac killer was cab driver Paul Stine. Like many of the previous attacks, this would no doubt have been treated by the police as a routine, entirely unrelated crime if it were not for the Zodiac’s claims of responsibility.</p><p>Stine had been shot and robbed of his wallet, reminiscent of a spate of other cab robberies that had plagued the area around that time. Eyewitnesses who saw the killer leave the cab described the assailant as a white man with a crew cut and glasses aged between 25–30.</p><p>This was one of only 2 descriptions we can reliably assume were of the killer. But the other, from surviving Zodiac victim Mike Mageau, describes a shooter who did not wear glasses and had short curly hair, not a crew cut.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-killer-police-sketch.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Police sketch of Paul Stine’s killer</div></figcaption></figure><p>Stine's killer, whoever it was, certainly appeared to be someone other than the person who wrote the letters. In an anniversary special on the Zodiac killings published in 1991, the Napa times reported that a bloody fingerprint from the Stine cab did not match latent prints lifted off the letters.</p><p>Again, none of the forensic evidence gathered from the Stine murder scene, the prints or the ballistics, provided any link at all to any of the other crimes attributed to the Zodiac.</p><p>Only the claims of responsibility in a series of letters, sent to local newspapers by someone calling themselves the Zodiac, and a couple of phone calls to the police, provided any links between the crimes. But just how believable are these?</p><h3>This is the Zodiac speaking</h3><p>The first problem with the Zodiac letters starts right at the beginning, with the 2 murders at Lake Herman Road in late 1968. For a killer so keen to take credit for and boast about his actions, it takes him more than 6 months to make any mention of these murders.</p><p>His first brief reference is in a phone call made to the police shortly after the second attack on Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau, in which he states — “I want to report a murder. If you will go one mile east on Columbus Parkway you will find kids in a brown car. They were shot with a nine millimeter Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Goodbye”.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-vallejo-phone-booth-call.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Someone phoned the police from this Vallejo phone booth claiming responsibility for the murders</div></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst he offers nothing that can corroborate his claim to be responsible for the December murders, he does provide one checkable fact for the July 4 attack — that he used a 9mm Luger.</p><p>For anyone who had discussed the matter with detectives, overheard police transmissions or been around the murder scene, it was a reasonable assumption that Ferrin was killed with a Luger because of the bullets and shells found by police.</p><p>But subsequent analysis by ballistics experts found that the murder weapon was not a Luger, but a similar semi-automatic pistol that took the same ammunition — a Browning Hi-Power. On the night of the call, this fact was known only to the true killer, and the caller appeared unaware of it.</p><p>Clearly the phone call itself provided no compelling evidence that the caller was responsible for the December and July 4 murders, and actually tended to argue against the idea.</p><blockquote><span>\"I want to report a murder.

Goodbye\"</span><br><cite></cite></blockquote><p>In the first letter sent to Bay Area newspapers on July 31, the writer provides evidence that he says proves he was responsible for the Lake Herman Road and Darlene Ferrin murders. Vallejo Police Chief Jack Stiltz was, however, unconvinced</p><p>Talking to reporters, Stiltz said that the writer had demonstrated no knowledge that could not have been gleaned from the newspapers or by overhearing police chatter. Hoax letters, phone calls and even false confessions are a depressingly familiar prospect for any major police department caught in the middle of a high-profile case and Stiltz’ scepticism was warranted.</p><p>A few days later, the writer tries again. In his second letter, mailed to the Examiner, he tells a fanciful tale about taping a torch to his gun in the December murders, but offers no other details that might prove he was the real killer, such as what clothes his victims were wearing, something not reported in the newspapers.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/this-is-the-zodiac-speaking-letter.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">A second letter received tried to offer proof that the writer was the real killer</div></figcaption></figure><p>He offers more information about the murder of Darlene Ferrin, claiming that he shot Mike Mageau in the knee and did not, as reported in the papers, leave the scene at high speed with tires squealing, instead leaving slowly so as not to draw attention to himself.</p><p>Both these ‘facts’ offered by the writer, now calling himself The Zodiac, appear to be wrong. Mike Mageau was not shot in the knee, and both he and other witnesses did describe the shooter as leaving the scene at high speed, with engines racing and tires squealing.</p><p>The writer of these first 2 letters do appear to be the same person, but nothing contained in them genuinely provided any unarguable evidence that he was the true perpetrator of the 2 attacks, or even anything that could not have been learnt from other sources.</p><p>The next canonical Zodiac attack came at Lake Berryessa in September. Curiously, the assailant there had become somewhat shy, not only hiding behind his bizarre ‘Zodiac’ disguise but failing to write any letters boasting about his actions.</p><p>He does, however, leave a message on the victims’ car door, consisting of the dates of the previous attacks and the latest one, signed with the Zodiac’s crosshair logo. Shortly later, someone phoned the Napa police claiming credit for the ‘double murder’, but offered no information only known to the killer.</p><p>Likewise, the car door message contains nothing about the previous attacks not already in the public domain, and only bears a superficial resemblance to the handwriting from the letters. Tellingly, the writer does not seem to know his own name ‘Zodiac’. This would be understandable if the writer was a hoaxer since that fact had not yet been publicly revealed by the police.</p><p>Everything about the Lake Berryessa murders suggests a copycat attack by someone other than the writer of the letters, and the car door message and phone call provide no evidence to suggest otherwise.</p><p>When the letter from the Zodiac appeared on October 13 claiming credit for the murder of cab driver Paul Stine, the police were surprised as they had believed the killing was simply a robbery-murder, just like the spate of similar crimes against cab drivers that had plagued the city all year.</p><p>The text of the Zodiac’s October 13 letter makes several dubious claims and contain no insights that would prove he was the true killer of Stine. San Francisco Police Inspector Martin Lee was unimpressed by the Zodiac’s latest correspondence.</p><p>“His boast of being in the area we were searching while we were searching it is a lie”, Lee said in a San Francisco Chronicle report on the case. The article further stated that detectives were well aware that many of the Zodiac’s previous claims were also lies.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-paul-stine-shirt.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The letter writer sent a piece of Paul Stine’s bloody shirt to the San Fransisco Chronicle</div></figcaption></figure><p>This latest letter could easily be dismissed as another hoax if not for a piece of bloody cloth, seemingly ripped by the killer from Paul Stine’s shirt, sent alongside the letter to the Chronicle. Of all of the evidence offered by the writer of the letters, this was by far the most convincing.</p><p>Whilst the piece of shirt did nothing to prove the Zodiac was responsible for the earlier murders, it certainly seems compelling evidence he must have killed Stine. But could the writer have acquired the bloody shirt some other way?</p><p>The possibility that someone, a cop, a reporter or someone else with insider connections had somehow managed to obtain the shirt piece after the murder cannot be overlooked. It would not be the first time that police investigations had been breached like this.</p><p>The history of crime detection is replete with hoaxers and frauds that have managed to garner what looked like insider information ‘only the killer could have known’.</p><h3>Only the killer could have known</h3><p>There are numerous examples of murder investigations been derailed by hoaxers who seem to have information that convinces the police they must be the real killer.</p><p>The granddaddy of all serial killer cases — Jack the Ripper, contains several parallels with the Zodiac case. Like the Zodiac, Jack gave himself his famous name in a taunting letter he wrote to the police. Several other letters were written by someone claiming to be Jack, a serial murderer of prostitutes in Whitechapel, London in 1888.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/jack-the-ripper-from-hell-letter.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">All of the letters attributed to Jack the Ripper are thought to be hoaxes</div></figcaption></figure><p>Some of these letters contain details that appeared to show the writer knew details of the crime scenes not generally known. Another was even accompanied, like the Stine shirt, by a piece of physical evidence — a human kidney said to have come from the Ripper’s 4th victim Catherine Eddowes.</p><p>Today, the majority of Ripper historians believe all of the letters attributed to ‘Jack the Ripper’ are hoaxes. Indeed whilst the murders were very real, the character of Jack the Ripper evoked in the letters was a fictional creation, probably dreamt up by journalist Thomas Bulling in order to keep the lurid case on the front pages.</p><p>It’s quite possible Bulling was able to insert authentic sounding facts into some of the letters by his associations with rogue police detectives, the incestuous two-way sharing of information between the press and the police as prevalent then as it is in today’s tabloid world.</p><p>Could the Zodiac letters be the creation of an enterprising 1960s equivalent of Thomas Bulling? Could the authentic details in the letters have been given to him by his contacts in the police department?</p><p>Other examples indicate insider contacts in the police are not necessary for a hoaxer to create a convincing facsimile of a real killer. In the late 1970s in Northern England, police were closing in on serial killer Peter Sutcliffe when a hoaxer managed to deflect the investigation down a cul-de-sac which probably cost at least 3 women their lives.</p><p>Dubbed ‘Wearside Jack’, John Samuel Humble sent letters and an audio tape to the Yorkshire Police that convinced them he had knowledge only the real killer could have known. Because of this, and Humble’s strong Wearside accent, the whole investigation was moved away from West Yorkshire, were Sutcliffe operated, to the North East of England.</p><p>In actual fact, Humble had no inside information, he just read the papers and paid attention. Because of the size and complexity of the inquiry, police had simply become unaware of what information had and had not become public. Humble was finally caught 24 years later and sentenced to 8 years for perverting the course of justice.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/albert-de-salvo.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">Albert De Salvo seemed to know details of crimes he probably didn’t commit</div></figcaption></figure><p>A contemporary serial killer case to the Zodiac is that of Albert de Salvo — the Boston Strangler. De Salvo confessed to all 13 murders attributed to the Strangler and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1967, just a year before the Zodiac murders began.</p><p>Despite the conviction, there is a growing belief amongst forensic investigators that De Salvo was innocent of at least some of the murders, and as a compulsive liar was able to insert convincing sounding, but erroneous information into his confessions to fool the police.</p><p>Crime author Casey Sherman believes some of the younger victims may have been unrelated murders disguised by the perpetrators to look like Strangler murders to provide them with an alibi, a suspicion echoed in the Zodiac case.</p><h2>Evidence against</h2><h3>The bigger picture</h3><p>Despite the vast number of differing theories as to the identity of the Zodiac killer, most of them agree on one thing — that a single individual committed the murders, made the phone calls, and wrote the letters attributed to the Zodiac.</p><p>A certain baseline of generally uncontested assumptions exists that are accepted by most theorists and even the original investigators in the case. If they are true, then it makes the idea that the Zodiac killer was a hoax or never really existed hard to countenance.</p><p>Law enforcement at the time, and most theorists today, believe that the writer of the letters and the individual who wrote the message on the car door of the victims at Lake Berryessa were the same person, due to handwriting matches made by experts like Sherwood Morrill.</p><p>If the letter writer really was a hoaxer, rather than a murderer, then he would have had to have somehow stumbled upon the Lake Berryessa crime scene by chance in order to be present to write on the car door, which seems unlikely.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-pieces-of-paul-stine-shirt.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The pieces of bloody shirt the letter writer sent appeared to prove he was the true killer of Paul Stine</div></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, unless he had inside help from the police, the letter writer almost certainly murdered cab driver Paul Stine, because of the piece of Stine’s bloodied shirt he sent alongside his letter taking responsibility for the crime.</p><p>It seems likely then, that the letter writer calling himself the Zodiac, probably did murder Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa and Paul Stine in San Fransisco. But did he commit the other Zodiac murders or just claim credit for them?</p><p>If the other canonical Zodiac murders were not the work of the same man, then we must posit multiple killers committing similar murders in a relative small area at the same time, which seems statistically improbable.</p><h3>The Zodiac’s signature</h3><p>Although the killings do appear to show different methodologies, this is not as unusual as is often thought. In criminologist Robert D Keppel’s book about serial murderers — Signature Killer, he describes what he calls ‘m.o. purism’, a tendency amongst law enforcement to only link separate murders if the method used is exactly the same.</p><p>According to Keppler, serial killers do sometimes change their m.o. — modus operandi, as they strive to become more comfortable in the specific circumstances of each successive murder. But what doesn’t change, according to former FBI criminal profiler John Douglas, is the killers ‘signature’.</p><p>“We came to realize that while m.o. was important, in certain types of crimes it wasn’t nearly as important as what I call ‘signature’”, Douglas wrote. “The unique aspect that was critical not so much to accomplish the crime as to satisfy the perpetrator emotionally”.</p><p>For the Zodiac, the signature of his murders seemed to be the exerting of control and the demonstration of his superiority over the public and the police via his letters, a common thread that does seem to link the crimes, even where the methodologies are different.</p><p>It could also be argued that the different methods the Zodiac employed in his crimes were simply employed out of expediency. For example, his use of a disguise and knife at Lake Berryessa may be because he committed the attack in daylight and wished to avoid detection.</p><p>But whilst that attack and the Paul Stine murder appeared to be very different, both exhibited the same ‘signature’ use of messages and phone calls to the police that sought to assert the Zodiac’s control over the investigation.</p><figure class=\"media flex gap-s\" data-role=\"gallery-item\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://d6jf304m27oxw.cloudfront.net/zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer/zodiac-letter-school-bus.jpg?-i2\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"><figcaption class=\"media-caption\"><div class=\"wrap wrap-narrow wrap-padding\">The Zodiac killer’s threat to blow up a school bus caused panic in San Fransisco</div></figcaption></figure><p>This need for control culminated in the threat he made in his October 13 1969 letter to the Chronicle in which he said he would blow up a school bus and pick off the children as they fled. This essentially singled him out as a kind of terrorist, using his crimes and the letters to cause fear and anxiety amongst the populace.</p><p>The Zodiac murders have almost become a parlour game, a giant jigsaw puzzle with many of the pieces missing. Like many such cases where hard facts are few and far between, speculation and assumption have filled the gaps.</p><p>Often, like the half truths and gossip packaged as investigative journalism by Robert Graysmith, facts get substituted by fiction in the public’s mind.</p><p>But even though much of Graysmith’s mythology has been exposed as nonsense, many of his basic assumptions about the case are still widely accepted as correct by most theorists and investigators.</p><p>By challenging these most fundamental assumptions about the case, authors like Thomas Horan have created a credible argument that questions the very existence of the Zodiac killer.</p><p>When the speculation and myths are stripped away, what’s left does suggest the possibility that the famous Zodiac killer may be a phantom, a fictional bogeyman we choose to keep alive because sometimes our darkest fears make for a far better story than the mundane truth.</p>","tile":"zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer","path":"zodiac-serial-murders-the-phantom-killer","date":"2018-02-21T21:20:32.000Z","formatteddate":"Feb 21, 2018","baseurl":"https://www.theunredacted.com","headline":"Zodiac Serial Murders","subheadline":"The Phantom <span>Killer</span>","snippet":"Was the legendary serial killer the Zodiac a hoax?","tags":["murder","serial","killer","Zodiac","unsolved","hoax","mystery","San Francisco","letters","newspapers","police","Graysmith","Vallejo","California","1969"],"title":"Zodiac Serial Murders - The Phantom Killer","tileheadline":"The Phantom Killer"}]
